I currently have X amount of dollars in bills a month. Have a job to where I can easily pay these bills monthly and save 20 percent of paycheck a week. Which is DCA’d daily into Bitcoin. I’m guess I’m trying to justify in my brain how to DCA more into Bitcoin by taking the amount of money I owe a month on bills plus the 20 percent I already DCA daily and when a bill comes due it comes out of my bank account and then I sell those Sats to replace what was taken out of my bank account. In theory and the long run I would have more SATS than if I just did 20 percent DCA. Can anyone please let me know if this is viable? I know there will be a Bear market where I will be losing money in the short term but at the same time I will be lowering my dollar cost average doing it this way. ,0.72

I argued that we (in germany) have 25% taxes on capital gains which would not be there if we could save in euro.

Today, I'm debt-free with a healthy portfolio and actual savings. All thanks to taking a chance on Bitcoin.
I still remember my coworker talking about crypto back in 2017 and me laughing it off as internet funny money. After weeks of him showing me charts and explaining the technology, I reluctantly threw in $500 I could barely afford just to shut him up.
Best decision of my life.
That initial investment turned into my obsession. I started researching everything I could about blockchain, decentralization, and investment strategies. I set up automatic weekly buys with whatever I could spare ($20-50). Those small consistent purchases added up more than I ever imagined.
When the 2021 bull run hit, my portfolio exploded. I was smart enough to take some profits (paid off $23k in student loans) but kept most invested. Even through the crash and bear market, my average buy price kept me well in the green.
But the biggest change wasn't just financial - Bitcoin completely shifted my mindset. I went from someone who couldn't save a penny to someone thinking about long-term wealth building. I started learning about traditional investing, opened a Roth IRA, and even got serious about my career to increase my income.
For anyone on the fence about crypto - I'm not saying throw your life savings in. But the journey of learning and small consistent investing changed everything for me.
Anyone else have life-changing experiences with Bitcoin?

The Bitcoin community points out that newcomers often think they’re too late. People considering Bitcoin for the first time look at the price history and think they missed their chance. Similarly, especially during Bitcoin’s most exciting times, people look at the price and think, “it’s too expensive”.

The funny thing is, that’s been true since before 2013 and a $90 price. I know because I had those same thoughts back then. And I expect people to have similar thoughts at $125,000 and then at $250,000 and then at $500,000.

One Bitcoin went from buying 2 Big Macs in 2012 to over 11,000 Big Macs in 2024. It went from needing 28,000 Bitcoin to buy a typical house in 2012 to just 6 in 2024. That’s a huge jump but it’s also an ongoing trend – there’s still a lot of room for Bitcoin to grow even more in the future.

New technologies tend to follow a predictable adoption curve, starting with a small group of innovators and early adopters before gaining traction with the broader public as things improve.

In 1994 Bryant Gumbel, a host of the popular Today Show, stumbled through trying to understand an email address. Bryant asked, “What is internet anyway?”

His co-host, Katie Couric, responded, “Internet is that massive computer network, the one that’s becoming really big now”. Bryant asked, “What, do you write to it, like mail?”

The next year, famous comedian David Letterman had Bill Gates on his late night talk show. Letterman asked, “What about this internet thing, do you know anything about that?”. Bill Gates said, “Sure,” and talked a bit about how it lets people publish information and send email. Letterman poked fun at Gates the entire time. 

When Gates talked about the ability to listen to a baseball game online, Letterman jokingly asked, “Have you heard of radio? Do tape recorders ring a bell?” Gates went on to describe the most basics of social networking. By that point Letterman was laughing in his face and the crowd laughed along.

In those days the Internet was an emerging technology, not yet mainstream. I remember reading business magazines at the time – printed on paper. They had articles with titles like, “Is it time for you to put your business online?” Then the entire article would explain all the reasons you shouldn’t bother to have a website for your business.

In 1998, Paul Krugman, a distinguished professor of economics, said:

***The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in 'Metcalfe's law'–which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants–becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's.***

Ok, it can be fun to look back at the early days of things and poke fun at the people who didn’t understand what was coming. 

But it’s also educational to look at how society initially reacts to new, unfamiliar things as they emerge and grow. There is always a some amount of fear, uncertainty, and doubt around new things.

In 1995 the internet had about 16 million users. That was about 0.3% of the world’s population at the time. Ten years later (2005) it was a bit over 1 billion users, or about 15% of the world’s population. Another ten years (2015) got it to well over 3 billion users, 43% of world population. Today the internet has more than 5 billion users which is about 66% of the world’s population.

The internet is not the only interesting new technology we can look at. Here are two others that made history:



**Credit Cards** 

The idea of a small plastic card that lets you charge purchases started in the 1970s. Before 1980 credit cards were owned by about 50 million users worldwide. That was about 2% of the worldwide adult population at the time. By the end of the 1980s they were used by about 150 million people, or about 5% of the world’s adult population.

In 1993 a local TV news station went into a Burger King restaurant in the US. The restaurant had just started accepting credit cards. The news station asked customers what they thought about using credit cards to buy Burger King food. 

One customer said, “I think it’s pretty bad if you have to use a credit card when you go to a fast food restaurant,” and then expressed concern that someone would have to “call New York” to confirm the transaction. Another customer said, “I just hope it doesn’t slow things down.” A third customer, a gray haired gentleman dressed in a suit and tie, said, “I just can’t imagine it working on a day-to-day basis.”

About 400 million people owned credit cards at the time, or about 10% of adults worldwide (100 million in the US, or about 53% of adult Americans).

From there usage steadily increased. Today credit cards are used by about 1.2 billion people, about 22% of adults worldwide (200 million in the US, or about 80% of adult Americans).



**Smartphones**

In 1992, Andy Grove, CEO of Intel, described the idea of a wireless personal communicator in every pocket as ""a pipe dream driven by greed"". The first smartphone was released back in 1994 but only got about 50,000 users.

But in 2007 the iPhone came out and the overall market quickly got to 122 million users worldwide, or about 1.8% of the world’s population. Microsoft's CEO at the time, Steve Ballmer, stated: ""There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share.""

By 2015 the overall smartphone market was at 2.6 billion users worldwide, or about 35% of world population. Today we’re looking at almost 7 billion users, about 84% of the planet.



That’s a basic review of several technologies that emerged in the past. How does Bitcoin compare?

It can be difficult to pin down exactly how many people own Bitcoin today. But specialists at companies like Chainalysis study data from Bitcoin apps and conduct surveys to count users in the US and worldwide. They report that about 300 million people own Bitcoin today. That’s about 3.7% of the world’s population.

That’s roughly similar to 1980 for credit cards. Or the late 90s for the internet. Or about 2009 for smartphones.

Most people in the world don’t own any Bitcoin yet. Big companies and even governments are just now starting to take it seriously. 

We recently passed the stage where Steve Balmer the CEO of Microsoft said, ""There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share."" We’ve just barely reached the stage where David Letterman laughed at Bill Gates and suggested the internet was no more useful than radio and tape recorders. We’re not yet at the stage where a Burger King customer looked at the restaurant’s new credit card readers and said, “I just can’t imagine it working on a day-to-day basis”.

There’s a long way to go before Bitcoin *really* catches on.

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](https://imgur.com/a/5w3l2A6) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://river.com/learn/how-bitcoin-fees-work/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin try [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://aggr.trade/1m1h) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth 
--------------|--------|------------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A 
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | 

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Hi guys, I am developing after hours open source BTC tracker, I have base layers but it still needs some work.

Basically, it's an web app where you can add/import your buy/sell transactions (ps. I will never implement the sell function haha) of BTC and we can track current price, P&L of each purchase etc.

Working on internal imported data, you don't need to connect anything (wallet/exchange/etc).

Just to keep my motivation, would anyone will be actually intrested to run it on his server/homelab/personal PC?

Installation will be simple, just run npm app (its written mainly in JS with node) or run docker container.

Some screenshots in the attachments :)

But it does raise a question that has puzzled me for a long time and I'm curious how people are managing it. There doesn't seem to be a completely foolproof answer on the internet.

I'm pretty confident that my seed phrases are safely stored, so I don't worry about them being stolen. The problem is that they are not readily accessible, even to me.

Remembering a sequence of 12 to 24 words in a precise but nonsensical order is basically impossible, unless you're the Real Rain Man from YouTube or the guy who can tell the shopkeeper the UPC code for everything he just bought or your man who can tell you the value of *π* to the nth decimal place, well, you're going to forget your seed phrase.

I don't need a seed phrase often, but I have needed one before and it's very inconvenient to access it.

Are there any simple ways that balance safety and convenience?

I'm not trying to get you to tell me how you store your seed phrases, so ***please don't do that***.

I find it interesting where the meanings for a lot of our financial terms come from.

For instance; ***salt*** was used so much as money originally, that it is the root for the word ""salary"" which comes from ***salarium***, meaning payment in salt.

**Banco** means *bench or table*. Medieval moneylenders sat at benches. If a banker failed, their bench was broken — *banca rotta* = *bankrupt*.

**Credit** is Latin and means ""to believe or trust"" as in you believe someone will pay you back.

**Fiat** means ""let it be done"" or essentially ***I declare.*** Meaning, I declare this has value.

Lets make a sentence and translate it:

**""Fiat money is created using credit""** roughly translates into\*\*: ""I declare this newly made money has value and you believe that it will be paid back eventually""\*\*

1jw5ss5,2025-04-10 19:00:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jw5ss5/do_you_know_what_is_cashu/,Do you know what is Cashu?,0,14,"Cashu is an open-source ""ecash"" (electronic cash) protocol built on top of Bitcoin. It was designed to bring more privacy, speed, and anonymity to Bitcoin transactions, functioning as a kind of ""digital cash"" that mimics the properties of physical money. The idea is based on the ""ecash"" concept created by David Chaum in the 1980s, but adapted to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

# How does it work?

Cashu operates with two main components:

1. **Mint**: An entity (which can be anyone or any organization) that issues digital tokens called ""ecash."" These tokens are backed by Bitcoin deposited into the mint via the Lightning Network (a second-layer solution for fast and cheap Bitcoin transactions).
2. **Wallet**: Users store these tokens in their own digital wallets, as if they were banknotes in their pocket.

When you deposit Bitcoin into a mint, it gives you ecash tokens in return. These tokens can be used to make instant, private transactions between users or services without leaving traces on the Bitcoin blockchain. Later, you can redeem those tokens for Bitcoin if you wish.

# What makes it special?

* **Privacy**: Cashu uses a technique called ""blind signatures,"" which prevents the mint from knowing who is spending the tokens or where they’re going. It’s like using physical cash: no one knows whose bill it is or how you spent it.
* **Speed**: Ecash transactions are instant and nearly cost-free because they happen off the main Bitcoin blockchain, typically via the Lightning Network.
* **Flexibility**: Anyone can set up a mint and issue tokens, making the system decentralized and accessible.

# Practical example

Imagine you want to buy a coffee from a friend who accepts Cashu. You deposit 1,000 satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin) into a mint and receive a 1,000-sat ecash token. You send that token to your friend anonymously, and they can either use it or redeem it for Bitcoin back at the mint. The mint doesn’t know who you are or who you sent the token to.

# Limitations

* **Custody**: The mint is a point of trust. You need to trust that it will honor the tokens and not run off with the deposited Bitcoin.
* **Not a Bitcoin replacement**: Cashu isn’t an alternative to Bitcoin itself but a tool to enhance privacy in custodial systems.

In summary, Cashu Bitcoin is an extra layer in the Bitcoin ecosystem that enables fast, private, and anonymous transactions, like digital pocket money, but it still relies on trust in the mint operator. It’s ideal for micropayments, anonymous donations, or situations where you want more privacy than Bitcoin alone provides.",0.38

To fully flesh out the physics of Bitcoin in a Type I, II, and III civilization required me to create some new models for Bitcoin mining and usage. I've gone ahead and organized my thoughts inside this paper. 

# Abstract:

`This paper explores the feasibility of Bitcoin mining and usage as humanity advances through the Kardashev Scale, from a planetary (Type I) to a stellar (Type II) and ultimately a galactic (Type III) civilization. We analyze how Bitcoin and its Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism can adapt to vastly different energy capacities, and interstellar-spanning distances. This paper proposes ideas such as new necessary mathematical models for hashrate efficiency, relative hashrate, and a Mining Feasibility Index to provide a framework for assessing mining viability across interplanetary and interstellar distances. Additionally, we propose the use of Federated Proof-of-Work sidechains and localized second-layer networks to enable scalable and secure usage of Bitcoin across stellar and galactic distances, even in the presence of relativistic travel and causality constraints. This work outlines a long-term vision for how Bitcoin could remain viable in a high-energy, space-faring future.`",0.66

This notion is based on the idea that both BTC and gold are capped, but this is not exactly true.

Bitcoin is capped at 21M coin, and there is a finite amount of gold on Earth, yes, that's correct. However, NASA and other tech firms are exploring mining options for asteroids containing gold.

Most people aren't cognitively capable of understanding and comprehending the size of celestial bodies, but golden asteroids and infinite gold are basically the same thing.

If mining is conducted on golden asteroids, the amount of gold will be so huge, that we can assume we will never run out of gold or reach a point where demand outpaces the supply.

If space mining happens, gold price will go down significantly.

It will eventually happen, it's just a matter of time until we have fully re-usable rockets and launching costs are reduced to the point, where constant launches, missions and returning rockets are a profitable business.

Bitcoin solves this, because there are no asteroids containing Bitcoins.

Gold will always be finite... until it isn't.

Technically, Bitcoin's 21M supply can be increased, but this requires the approval of nodes and miners, meaning everyone will have to agree to lose profits, meaning it's never gonna happen.

Gold is irreplaceable part of modern electronics, yet Bitcoin still outperforms gold.",0.7

I have been in crypto since 2017. I read everything I could on it before making my first purchase. I bought a ledger a long time ago as it was one of the most secure item to hold my cryptos. All my crypto-savings were on it.

A couple days ago I saw that my PayPal account has been hacked and someone stole 1000$ by making a purchase with my credit card. I called my bank, cancelled it and got refunded.

This morning I went on the ledger app to check my btc and saw 3$ instead of the 30k (0.3BTC) I had. And then everything clicked. Someone did not hacked my PayPal but my iCloud. And somehow found my encrypted file with some seeds on it.

It is my entire fault and I am the only responsible for what happened to me.

I guess this message is to warn everyone. Sometimes your crypto is secured, but something else isn’t and they hack from there.

To the person who stole my money, have fun with it, I personally hope that you will choke on it and die slowly.


Edit: guys I know I was dumb. Don’t rub it in. 
To answer the most common comment, yes I know that you don’t write your seed phrase online. But when I bought my ledger in 2018 I didn’t know. And I did not even remember I did that. Like I said: it’s on me. ",0.86

Back in 2006, I was part of a small tech forum where Bitcoin was first introduced as a digital currency. This was well before the first block of Bitcoin was ever mined, and it was presented by a group of about 5-6 forum admins and moderators. The forum, which had around 50-70 members with a fluctuating number of unregistered visitors, was the birthplace of what would later become one of the most revolutionary financial technologies.

Bitcoin wasn’t just a concept at that time—it was a **working prototype**, and we were already mining it. The software provided was incredibly simple, almost rudimentary, but it was functional. Mining involved a button within the wallet software that opened a command prompt (CMD) window showing the mining process. The mining speed was dependent on factors like internet speed, GPU, and CPU performance.

# Key Features and Observations:

* **The Bitcoin Wallet:** At this stage, the wallet was a basic software with a minimalist interface, resembling a simple white window with a mining button.
* **Mining:** Mining could already be done using your CPU and GPU, and transactions were being conducted, though at very small volumes—fractions of Bitcoin in the range of **0.XXXXXX BTC**. These transactions were small, typically only fractions of a Bitcoin, and occurred a few times per day.
* **Transaction Visibility:** There was a feature within the wallet that allowed you to see the transaction history, displaying wallet addresses and transaction amounts in a peer-to-peer system. These were low-volume transactions, reinforcing the early, experimental nature of Bitcoin.
* **Satoshi Nakamoto:** It’s worth noting that ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" was not a single person but a **pseudonym** or **synonym** for the group of developers behind the project. The identity of Satoshi remains a mystery to this day, and the name represents the collective efforts of the community rather than an individual.
* **The Forum & Website:** The tech forum where this all started was powered by **MyBB** or **vBulletin**, and served both as a place for discussions and as a hub for updates about Bitcoin. The website was more of an informational platform, providing details about the project, images, and links to the forum for community engagement.
* **Early Adoption:** Around 2 years after my first interaction with the wallet, I checked back to the forum and was met with the announcement that the **first Bitcoin block had been successfully mined**, marking a proud milestone for the community.

# The Bitcoin Logo:

The Bitcoin logo, at the time, from my memories was different from what we know today. It had a more **minimalist** design, with **blue and white colors** (rather than the current orange and white), and it was less bold than the logo we recognize today.

It’s fascinating to think about how **Bitcoin** went from a humble, early prototype shared among a small tech-savvy community to the powerhouse it is today, revolutionizing the world of digital finance.

Although I no longer have access to my old hardware wallet (and I can only imagine what could have been had I kept it), the experience of being involved in the early days of Bitcoin gives me a unique perspective on its journey.

  
small edit : i just wanted to share my experience and memories to the publicity that give a insight to the bitcoin history.

I've been in this space for over a decade and early on I learned I should stay away from leverage... or rather I thought I did. For some reason (long story) I decided to go long on bitcoin with leverage. I wanted to be stress-free so I kept a significant balance (5 figures) and used little margin. I entered at around 82k last week and my liquidation was at around 74k, which I thought was very safe. All was good until Sunday. I can't explain the stress I suffered the following days. At some point the price touched 74.4k, very close to liquidation. The whole time I was literally [this guy](https://www.memeatlas.com/images/wojaks/wojak-stage-6-doomer.png) looking at the chart deciding whether to exit and lose 60/70/80% or wait. I couldn't work, eat, spend time with family or friends, or do anything other than think about why I did this stupid trade. It was money that I could afford to lose, but the psychological damage of losing it would have been hard. In any case I decided to wait. Fortunately yesterday I was able to exit safely with minimal loss (I could have waited more and exit with gains but I wanted to be out ASAP).

I think my life expectancy just dropped a little after all this, but hopefully this time I learned the lesson. No more leverage trading for me. I truly can't believe people do this on a daily basis!",0.95

I've been exploring the idea of using BTC as collateral to borrow funds, while maintaining long-term exposure and potentially avoiding taxable events from selling. However, my main concern is managing the repayment process.

For example, if I pledge *x* BTC as collateral for a loan of *x* dollars, the arrangement would require monthly repayments (interest, and possibly part of the principal). So, my question is: How do you fund these repayments without ever having to sell your BTC? Do you rely on other income sources entirely, or are there creative strategies that have worked for you?

I'm curious about your experiences, insights, and any pitfalls you've encountered with this strategy. Looking forward to your advice!

most people can't afford to lose a single thing, they're desperate for a solution.

So the best advice I could give you is: Because of the halving cycle which happens every 4 years or so, Bitcoin tends to be higher than it was before after 4 years, but between the time you buy and that 4 year time frame, a bear market can occur. So make sure to just buy Bitcoin not with ""what you can't afford to lose"", but with an amount of money you can afford to leave untouched for AT LEAST 4 YEARS. That way if a bear market starts you can wait for a better opportunity to leave without selling at a loss.

And finally:

4. Besides the previously advice, the ideal scenario is: NEVER SELL YOUR BITCOIN. HODL FOREVER.
That's not some meme advice, there's a reason why people tell everyone that.
If you sell your Bitcoin you're exchanging a valuable asset that increases its value over time, for an asset (USD, EUR, etc) that is based on being infinitely printed, decreasing its value over time. Why the hell would you do that?

If you keep your money in Bitcoin, 4 years from now you will need less Bitcoin to buy the same stuff today. On the other hand if you keep your money in Fiat, you will need more Fiat to buy the same stuff today.

The only situation you should sell your Bitcoin for Fiat is if you need to use fiat to pay for something that will save your life or the life of someone you love. Because at the end of the day that's more important than money.

But if you have another choice, always chose not to sell your Bitcoin. You have no reason to sell your Bitcoin. You can spend your Bitcoin if you want and replace it later, that's what Bitcoin was created for. But don't exchange your valuable Sats for trash Fiat without a really good reason. I can guarantee that you will regret it in the next 4 years.",0.92

Bitcoin is like a freezer and the dollar is like a refrigerator. Freezers do not compete with refrigerators. When you go shopping for a new refrigerator you are not comparing it to your deep freezer you have at home. Why? Because they both do different things and both solve different problems we have with food.

If you want to make eggs and have those for breakfast *tomorrow* or in the next *week* you keep them chilled but not frozen. If you want to drink milk or use some cheese you are going to keep them in a ready state. Are they slowly going bad? Yes. But you are willing to accept that for the ability to consume them anytime you want in the short-term without having to wait or have a weird taste.

If you want to preserve steak for 6+ months because you know you'll use it, just not sure when, you deep freeze it. If you want to keep food with certain properties because they are better that way (such as ice cream) you deep freeze it. Sure, you could always take the steak out and eat it, but it's going to hurt, a lot.

If you take Bitcoin and spend it, it's going to hurt, a lot. It's highest and best use case is not as a currency. It *can* be used as a currency just like the frozen steak *can* be eaten, however that's not ideal. It's highest and best use case is as a store of value against all other forms of spoilage and decay.

Last thought and I'll leave you with this....... Imagine you go over to your family's house and every time you're there they complain about food going bad and how they cannot store lots of meat and other things like ice cream. They don't understand how other people are doing it. And when you ask them to show you, you notice they only have a refrigerator in their kitchen! Well, your solution for them wouldn't be to tell them to get rid of the refrigerator because that's the thing causing them to not store food long term. You would tell them that they need to go buy a freezer and that will allow them to not only store food for longer but more of it! They can keep the refrigerator, it has it's place in the kitchen, but they need to understand it's purpose and that they're not supposed to use it to store ice cream.

This is what Michael Saylor means when he says that Bitcoin doesn't compete with the dollar.",0.87

If a miracle is going to happen, it will be performed by Bitcoin, not the other things I invest in. I do acknowledge that.

The most important question is, is escaping the Matrix and the 9-5 still possible or not?

BTC is the highest return investment currently in existence, but if the market cap doesn't reach 15-20T, I don't see how BTC can help me escape.

Since BTC is the highest return asset on Earth, if it can't help, then nothing can.

Should I just give up or keep living in artificial scarcity made by me so I can have more money to invest in Bitcoin?

Psychologically, I may be able to withstand to 2040, but continuing after that won't be possible. In other words, Bitcoin will either succeed long-term or I will press my turn off button (you know what I mean 😢 )

*Update: Today, Chinese tariffs have increased from the previously calculated 54%, to 105%. This has taken the estimated 5% increase in inflation from tariffs alone, to 7.1%,* ***bringing the total inflation estimates within a year from now to around 10%*** *— and this is without an increase in the money supply, just from rising prices.* *Depending on the response in interest rates from the Federal Reserve, this could rise.*

*The used estimates are not meant to be perfectly accurate, but rather a numerical representation of principles at play. A friend pointed out the important factor that many of the goods imported from countries under high tariffs, like China, will be replaced with countries that have lower tariffs, which is not taken account in the following math. Due to the difficulty in such estimates, it will be purposefully left out, but I would keep it in mind.*

*This is financial information, not advice.*

*--*

I wrote an article attaching theoretical increased inflation numbers that could occur due to recently announced vehicle tariffs by the United States. This resulted in an estimated **1.6%** CPI increase. Add that to the last reported inflation rate of 3.14%, resulting in a significant **4.74% inflation rate with auto tariffs alone.**

At the time, the automobile tariffs were considered the biggest factor in terms of anticipated economic impact — but now pale in comparison to the recent announcement, which apply to all goods including The United States’ major trading partners.

Putting the economic impact of new tariffs into perspective, about 10 to 17% of items purchased in the CPI basket are imported goods. Due to production processes including imported goods but assembled in the US and other factors, I’d venture to say the 17% number is closer to accurate.

We’ll do some very quick on a napkin on the back of a hand math:

Of that 17% of the CPI basket, here are it’s compositional estimates, and associated price increases with the new tariffs:  
29% comes from China, 4.93% of the total basket, with 72.27% increase in item cost.  
26% from Mexico, 4.42% of the total basket, with 25% increase in item cost.  
15% from EU, 2.55% of the total basket, with 16.5% increase in item cost.  
10% from Vietnam, 1.7% of the total basket, with 36.25% increase in item cost.  
9% from Canada, 1.53% of the total basket, with 25% increase in item cost.  
11% from elsewhere, 1.87% of the total basket, with 9.52% increase in item cost.

If you calculate a $100 basket of CPI goods with old tariffs, it would cost $106.27 with the new tariffs. **An inflation increase of 6.27%**

https://preview.redd.it/cgz1n5zngute1.png?width=1882&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc503260d5642c7383f99b17534fc09365502206

*Note: This is a general estimate assuming that imported goods are evenly weighted across the CPI basket. One could get a more accurate estimate by narrowing down what percentage of each weighted category is made by which country, but such specificity on what is already a guesstimate is unnecessary. The ‘other’ imported category is an assumed 9.52% increase, but with the new tariffs, it’s likely more significant.*

Let’s take that 6.27% and add in some other factors.

These calculations have included the auto tariff previously calculated, but not insurance, which was a .25% increase, bringing our total increase to 6.52%

Domestic production is also influenced by tariffs. We will add a conservative .33% increase in cost of CPI goods by domestic sources giving us **an estimated total 6.85% inflationary increase.**

Add that onto the current inflation rate of 3.14% and **we could see 10% inflation numbers within a year**. I believe this to be conservative.

Average US citizens are already struggling to live day to day, and these tariffs are a strong squeeze on an already stressed economy with little wiggle room. Any more pressure could cause economic flatline, and a significant step towards broader debt default. The Federal Reserve will have to lower rates at some point, the question is just how much blood will be in the street before they do — and if past sentiment prevails, I’m willing to guess quite a bit.

Let’s observe some potential universes resulting from this situation.

**Universe 1: Interest rates** ***are*** **lowered significantly and/or quickly enough to prevent significant economic damage. United States’ domestic production** ***also*** **increases in time.**  
This is best case scenario. Yes, inflation significantly increases, but so do domestic jobs. Your eggs now cost $6/dozen, but you and your friends are employed, and ideally $20k more a year than pre-tariff.

You can think of this equivalent to the United States creating significantly more USD, but most of it going to US citizens rather than foreign entities. I’m in assumption that this is the actual end goal of the current administration.

**Universe 2: Interest rates** ***are not*** **lowered significantly and/or quickly enough to prevent significant economic damage. United States’ domestic production** ***does not*** **increase in time**.  
A lack of cooperation between the US Federal Reserve and The White House would result in these tariffs wrecking the US Economy. Significant job loss and rising cost of living would create broad loan defaults, including the US government, leading to potential bank runs, etc. However, I don’t think a point of no return is truly the case, and can probably be remedied at some point through evasive action.

If you’ve seen or read Ray Dalio’s The Changing World Order, he mentions that nations would rather inflate their currency than default on loans and I agree. So it’s not a matter of *if* The Fed increases rates, but rather *when* they do, and if they do so adequately. The variable is how many people and businesses economically or spiritually die before then.

No matter the universe we enter, it will contain inflation, and economic instability. Those are the two economic conditions you can count on.

How to prepare for such environments? Seek antifragile philosophy, live off of less, contribute what you can, and the universe will give back.",0.53

Eventually, they would de-peg it to print more since they would have the ability to do so.

Gold did not solve the problem of central banks ability to print and debase currency, how would something pegged to bitcoin differ in any way? People could still transact in gold always, but obviously, due to portability and verifiability issues, it did not make it very convenient to do so. 

Is this where bitcoin differs? People would be able to transact without the hurdles of gold, and in theory would actually PREFER to transact in bitcoin rather than a CBDC? 

I think we are witnessing a global order restructuring in real time and all roads lead to bitcoin, but just curious on how that could look like? How would it be different than any other time where a new currency is created, and to give it confidence, it is pegged to a hard asset like gold. How would pegging it to bitcoin be any different? 

Is the general belief that no other currency will exist because they would not be able to compete with the immutability and ""hardness"" of bitcoin?

Any insights would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance",0.55

Like they don’t have a job that lets them buy a little Bitcoin every week, even if prices drop more. Like they don’t have enough savings to ride out a bear market. If you don’t have those basics, what are you even doing? You’ve got no business chasing life-changing gains if your own life is hanging by a thread.

If you’re living paycheck to paycheck, hoping your $1,000 portfolio will fix everything—wake up. Bitcoin isn’t a magic ticket out of a mess you made. It’s an asset for people who have their foundations in place—a steady job, an emergency fund, and the patience to stick around when everything starts to collapse.

The people winning in Bitcoin are the ones who are prepared. They buy when everyone else is too scared to. They don’t lose their minds when the market crashes because they knew it could happen—and they planned for it.

Most people here are just gambling addicts in disguise—calling themselves ""investors"" while chasing life-changing gains without a backup plan. If that’s you, stop lying to yourself. You don’t need Bitcoin at the moment—you need to sort out your financial life first.

My thoughts are that I think the article oversimplifies how macroeconomic events like tariffs affect Bitcoin, implying it should rise in response to government policy, when in reality investor behavior during uncertainty typically leads to selling risk assets across the board. I also think it overstates the role of crime in Bitcoin’s use, ignoring data showing illegal activity makes up only a small portion of transactions. The portrayal of Bitcoin as merely speculative also misses its use cases in remittances, inflation hedging (especially in restrictive or developing countries), and ongoing tech development like the Lightning Network. The reference to Bitcoin ETFs also lacks nuance, and overlooks how it also represents broader legitimacy. The sarcastic tone and facetious language doesn't help make the article sound serious and just alienates readers looking for an actual thoughtful analysis. 
Look, I get it. They're having fun with the ""I told you so"" attitude, but it isn't helpful, and comes across as punching down.  Reducing all interest in Bitcoin to ""Number Go Up"" ignores a significant portion of the global user base who value its decentralized, censorship-resistant, portable nature, ya know, the thing that actually makes it valuable besides speculation.

I’m Umut Kundukan, a developer for almost 20 years. After turning 40, I started thinking more seriously about what would happen to my Bitcoin if something happened to me.

While looking for a proper inheritance solution, I came across the usual suggestions. These included sharing your seed phrase with someone, trusting a custodian with sensitive info, or relying on random centralized services. None of that felt right to me. I found it disturbing how often the advice boiled down to “just give someone access.”

So I decided to build something myself.

Over the last 9 months, I’ve been working on a tool with a few old friends. It is called BitInPeace, and it is meant for long-term holders like me who want to protect their loved ones without giving up sovereignty or privacy.

Here is how it works in short:  
You create and store a signed Bitcoin transaction that would send your BTC to a backup address, but only if you become inactive.  
The system monitors wallet activity. If you stay inactive past the time you set, the transaction gets broadcast. **No private keys are ever accessed. Only your signed transaction is stored.**

To make it easier to try, we also support wallets that allow signing and broadcasting separately.  
We have tested with Ledger, Trezor, Unisat, Exodus, and Phantom. You can even use a burner wallet and load it with a small amount (like 0.0002 BTC) to try it out without putting any real funds at risk.  
Just to be clear, I have no affiliation with any of these wallets.

If you decide to try it, you will be asked for credit card details, but nothing is charged upfront. It just starts a free trial, and you can cancel right after testing it. If anything feels off, just message me and I will make sure you are not billed.

I also recorded a short demo video showing how it works with a burner wallet. If it is okay, I will share the link in a comment.

I am not here to pitch anything. I would really like to hear your honest feedback. If you have thoughts on the idea, the experience, or anything that could be improved, I am all ears.

**The mods kindly allowed me to post this once.** I appreciate the opportunity and totally understand the need to be careful.

Normally I use anonymous accounts everywhere, but I am using this one to be transparent.

The calculator analyzes historical price data to show you how much Bitcoin you would have accumulated and the total amount invested. It’s an easy way to compare a consistent strategy against trying to time the market.

Swap your stable coin on Liquid Network to L-BTC. Since you bought the stable coin already inside the Liquid Network and transactions are confidential, the last thing anyone knows (including the government) is that you bought a stable coin version of your currency (which means no one can say you had any gains over time because of the 1:1 ratio stable coins have).

Then peg-out to BTC (search on Google how to do that). And done. You're good to go, you're the only person in the whole world that knows your stable coins were swaped to L-BTC and then turned into BTC.

And of course: Never sell your Bitcoin. Don't do this if you're a paper hand, it will be useless doing all that if you're gonna sell every time price drops a little.

I fully believe in Bitcoin, but the wording of some of these state reserve bills gives me a small, but hesitant pause in the purpose of these bills.

Firstly [Executive Order 14233](https://www.federalregister.gov/executive-order/14233)

Section 3 (a)

""The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known as the “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” capitalized with all BTC held by the Department of the Treasury that was finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any executive department or agency (agency) and that is not needed to satisfy requirements under [31 U.S.C. 9705](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/31/9705) or released pursuant to subsection (d) of this section (Government BTC).""

I'm no expert on all the language, but this order seems to be focused on seized assets. Why specifically call this out? does this give them authority to eventually seize Bitcoin like they did gold in the 70's?

Why not just specifically create a reserve and not include this language.  31 U.S.C. 9705 is a Department of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund indicating that this could be seized and used for other purposes.

Other State bills such as Arizona's SB1373 state the following.

""THE DIGITAL ASSETS STRATEGIC RESERVE FUND IS ESTABLISHED CONSISTING OF MONIES APPROPRIATED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND DIGITAL ASSETS THAT ARE SEIZED BY THIS STATE.""

Again why this language? There are other bills with similar language, but I have not spent enough time to find them all.

BTW. I believe the bill in Arizona has passed the regular sessions and just needs to be signed or Vetoed by the governor now, which is exciting.

Utah recently passed their bitcoin reserve bill, but I believe they amended the section about investing into the fund last min, which is disappointing. [https://bitcoinnews.com/adoption/utah-bitcoin-reserve-bill-change/](https://bitcoinnews.com/adoption/utah-bitcoin-reserve-bill-change/)

Overall I think bitcoin will continue on and thrive, but some of this language has me concerned of the true intentions in the background.

Anyone with knowledge in this area could share their thoughts on this ?

But I am also not buying in yet (I have zero investments currently) and I think every needs to hear me out and consider why.

First of all, this is only a slight downturn so far. So far like 20-30% loss. That's nothing compared to previous dips. It's too damn early. If I was invested I'm taking out every dime I had for at least a week. You are being irresponsible if you aren't doing this. 

This problem isn't ""magically"" going away. If the tariffs were cancelled tomorrow, prices will only rise so far, we aren't missing out on actual growth till things become stable...

And that is the issue, there is zero stability right now and it's gonna get only worse. 

It doesn't matter your politics, people on the right/center/left all agree on a crash.

People on the right have the best case scenario of ""we need this short term crash to fix the economy"".. well IF THIS IS THE BEST CASE SCENARIO, STOP PLAYING HODL AND GET THE F OUT FOR A FEW WEEKS!

BTC was at 60k literally 6 months ago. Go wait and buy back in then if you like the best case scenario.

Problem is, 60k BTC isn't a crash. The economy wouldn't be hurting much for 60k BTC to exist. It will probably be at 60k within 2 weeks. 

The right wing keeps saying you need the economy to hurt a bit in order to strong arm everyone into deals in order to declare a trade victory. Well the last time the economy was hurting was 2022, and BTC was in the teens and 20s then, 70% off it's all time high. This means best case scenario is a 70% drop, so BTC is in the 40s.

I will consider buying once it is below 50k, but will probably wait until it's a bit lower.. I don't see it going down to covid levels of under 10k but it'll probably hit either 19k or 29k as a bottom out point. 

I plan on buying in at those levels. To be honest anything above 40k feels expensive right now. ",0.21

- Dips due to economic crisis compound with fear of recession and losing one's job
- Not leaving dry powder on hand for a tasty dip is depressing and can make you invest more than you should
- Fear of not investing enough before it moves the new bottom, forever, is rough, and needs to be let go of
- Alt coins, even ones you truly believe in, dip hard AF and should be well accepted before even thinking about investing
- ADHD makes all of the above, even harder.

My question is, how do you navigate around the market based on the investment you made and the return you can get. 

Like, at what point will you freak out that your initial investment is nearing the current sales price? And what percentage away from the current sales price versus your original purchase price would you find yourself to be alert and trying to strategize what to do next?

Essentially each person keeps their private key in their own home whether it’s written down somewhere or memorized or whatever.

How would you envision this working out?  Example I know such and such a person has a decent amount on hand.  

How does he safely secure his btc while not becoming a target.  One can assume that there is btc in every home.  Is it safe for one to keep stacks of cash in their home?

How do you envision society working on my made up stage?

I've often found it very telling that bitcoin came out just shortly after the financial crisis of 2008 and that it almost seemed like a natural reaction to it, now that we are facing a global crisis that is further disparaging people of all economic backgrounds, it is evident in my view that we need to have faith in decentralization more than ever before.

Bitcoin has fallen below 75k

I see lots posts asking about price action 

But lets not forget that the goal is to create a peer-to-peer network - better than what we already have

Below is abstract from the Bitcoin paper as a reminder to the cause - 

Abstract.  A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.  Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work.  The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.  As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.  The network itself requires minimal structure.  Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.",0.44

I'm currently trying to help an older woman who was scammed out of her life savings—$93,000 in Bitcoin. The scammers contacted her via email and phone, gained remote access to her computer, and ultimately transferred her BTC to the following wallets:

Each of these wallets made few transactions before forwarding the funds to what looks like a centralized exchange wallet:

That wallet has handled over 16,500 BTC and almost 54,000 transactions, so I’m guessing it's a hot wallet of a major exchange.

This is more of a long term and lagging indicator. Hashrate going up means more sophisticated participants are taking a long term investment approach to the network, regardless of short term news headlines. 

Btw, Bitcoin hash rate just hit a new ATH of 1 ZetaHash!!

**2) Check** [**mempool.space**](http://mempool.space)

are blocks still coming in? are they still limited to 1 every ten minutes? Then its business as usual. This is how the supply of bitcoins are constrained and why bitcoin is said to be the most scarce asset in existence. So nothing has changed.

**3) Check your wallet balance**

are your bitcoin(s) still there? congrats. you still own a fixed percentage of the 21 million. No one on earth has managed to bypass public-private key pairs. no one has guess your private key. Your coins are still secured by the amount of blocks mined since your last transaction. Also run a node if you can, so you're not relying on another party to give you information about the blockchain.

**3) Check the price**

is it zero? If a bug allows for the minting of more than 21 million btc or more than block reward, market will shoot first then ask questions later by selling to near zero before exchanges and the network can be halted. Then developers can try and save the chain. If it went down 20% or even 50% percent then go to step 4 and then start from step 1 again.

**4) Check news for reason for selloff**

news is mostly noise, but still might as well check just to see what market is reacting to. news can also be good for information about exchange hacks and insolvency, critical issues with hardware/software relating to bitcoin, big changes between large players (mstr,blackrock,nationstates), and general macro shifts.

**Conclusion**

Bitcoin is a long term play, so most market events can be seen as short term noise. These steps allow you to return back to the reality of the unchanged nature of bitcoin and its likely long term growth trajectory.

If you own 1 bitcoin, the market do what it wants, but at the end of the day you still 1 out of the 21 million and there's nothing anyone can do to change that. You can verify that by following these steps.

It's not just about the current market conditions; it's about understanding the underlying principles and potential of Bitcoin.

Right now, the market might be experiencing a downturn, but honestly, this is the perfect time to **stack more Bitcoin**. Every dip presents another opportunity to accumulate more at a lower price.

I don’t even know where to start. All I know is I need to get this off my chest.

Five years ago, I got into crypto with nothing but drive and hope. I wasn’t greedy. I wasn’t chasing Lambo dreams. I was just desperate to break out of the cycle I was stuck in. I was working two jobs, barely surviving, and I thought maybe this is my shot. Maybe crypto is my way out.

So I studied. I read every thread, followed every chart, joined every so-called “alpha group.” I sold things I needed literally pawned electronics, skipped meals just to fund my positions. I wasn’t reckless. I did my research. I thought I was playing it smart.

But life had other plans.

Every time I thought I caught a trend, the market flipped. Every breakout turned fake. Every “advisor” vanished after the pump. I followed strategies, used stop losses, diversified and still, I got wrecked. Over and over. It wasn’t just one bad trade it was a slow bleed. A thousand paper cuts. I’d recover a little, only to lose double the next week.

Then came the black swans: sudden crashes, rug pulls, exchange glitches, even a liquidation caused by an API delay. I lost money not just from bad trades but from bad luck, bad timing, and trusting platforms that collapsed without warning. It felt like the universe had a personal vendetta against me.

I didn’t just lose money. I lost years. I lost sleep. I lost friendships. I lost faith in myself.

Now, I’m sitting here with an empty wallet, a broken spirit, and a head full of regrets. I feel like I’ve aged a decade. And the worst part? People still say “you should’ve done your own research” like that changes anything. I did. I tried. I gave everything I had. But sometime life just shits on you. And it doesn’t care how careful you were.

I’m not asking for pity. I’m just asking what now? How do I even begin to rebuild when the foundation is dust? How do I tell my family I’ve got nothing to show after five years of “hustling”? How do I move on from this when it feels like all I did was dig my own grave?

If you’ve been here if you’ve lost it all please, talk to me. I just want to feel less alone. I need to believe it’s still possible to come back from this.

Because right now,I don’t know if I can.

Im aware that the chance of brute forcing a key are extremely low in chances though it has been done at past on luck (large bitcoin collider on bitcointalk). 

Im not spooked on the chance of my particular 1 address but it got me thinking 2 things. 

1. Is it better to split btc over multiple addresses to spread this risk ie if you had 2 btc is it worth doing 1 byc in 2 addresses. 

2. i know of multisig but not fully understanding of it. e.g if i multisig an address is it still under the hood just an obfuscated way to sign ie does it point together to 1 private key? so if i 2 of 3 does it just make a single private key that someone could beute force and thus more a business signing way to split fund authorisation for a spend to limit risk. 

For the above 2 points what are the amounts that should split for 80-200btc to limit risk.

Recently, someone asked me to create pendants featuring BTC, ₿, and XBT. It took a few attempts to get it right, but I managed to design several pieces—three of which have already been reserved by the person who proposed the idea. I rarely replicate any piece exactly the same way—each one is unique. My creative process can be a bit chaotic, so reproducing identical items is challenging!

All of my pieces are made from borosilicate laboratory-grade glass using a glass torch. After shaping them, I run each piece through a kiln at around 550°C, then gradually cool it to relieve tension in the glass.

I’ve been practicing lampworking since my school days (2010–2014) and recently decided to refocus on this craft, hoping to make it my main source of income.

Well we all know that we should be holding our own keys in cold storage. This is all great, but it does introduce one issue; inheritance planning. Most people probably haven't considered what happens if they die unexpectedly, which leaves family members with no way to gain access to the deceased person's Bitcoin stash.

I have spent months trying to solve this issue and come up with a way to pass on my holdings in case I pass away. The criteria I have for my inheritance plan are:
- No third party risks. Even heirs should not have access to my stash while I'm alive.
- Seed phrase has to remain in cold storage at all times.
- Will automatically give preselected heirs access after my death.
- Must be easy to understand for nontechnical users and non-bitcoiners.

After piecing together my strategy, I have finally come up with an overall strategy that meets all my criteria. I am now working on full documentation and step-by-step guide on how to set it up. I will be releasing it on here in the near future.
Meanwhile, I would like to ask you guys what your inheritance strategy is?",0.4

You know, anon, I may just be a random voice screaming into a digital void, but *wake up*. 

You’re being played. 

Saylor? BlackRock? Coinbase? They’ve built a glittering paper palace of IOUs, and they're handing you Monopoly money while calling it Bitcoin.

Let’s get something straight: **if you don’t run a node, and you don’t hold your own keys, you do NOT have Bitcoin.** You’ve got a IOU claim ticket, a promise, a polite “maybe” from a third-party middleman that your bitcoin *might* be somewhere… until they’re not.

**MicroStrategy stock is not Bitcoin. BlackRock ETFs are not Bitcoin.** They're glorified exposure vehicles built on layers of trust, custodial risk, and opaque rehypothecation games, tantamount to ""wrapped bitcoin"". 

They Are Shitcoins.

 And what do they all have in common? **Coinbase.** The same custodian for both that attacked Bitcoin during the blocksize wars. The same centralized honeypot. The same “trust us, bro” nonsense that blew up Mt. Gox, Celsius, BlockFi, and FTX.

They want you to stay passive. They want you to think holding a ticker symbol in your brokerage account is the same as holding digital gold. **It’s not.** That MSTR stock? It’s paper. That IBIT ETF? Paper. TradFi comfort food for people too afraid to take the one step that actually matters: **self custody.**

And guess what? They *don’t want you to do it.* They don’t want you to learn how to use a hardware wallet. They don’t want you to spin up a node. Because once you do, you don’t need them anymore. You become sovereign. You opt out. You *verify* instead of trust.

**Bitcoin was never about price exposure. It was about freedom.** About removing third party middlemen. About eliminating counterparty risk. You give that up the second you park your “Bitcoin” with a third party middleman in a BlackRock ETF or ""Bitcoin"" stock.

You think Larry Fink’s going to let you withdraw sats to your Coldcard when there's a run on coinbase? You think Saylor’s going to cut you a UTXO when coinbase is fully compromised like MTGOX? Hell no. You’re buying promises. And promises break when things get ugly.

If you're buying paper Bitcoin—whether it's MicroStrategy stock, BlackRock's ETF, or any other shiny TradFi wrapper—you’re not just getting scammed yourself… you're *part of the scam*.

Yeah, that’s right. When you buy these IOUs, you're **feeding the beast**.

You're handing your capital over to entities who *don’t* secure real Bitcoin for every share issued. Instead, they park Bitcoin with a third-party custodian—Coinbase in this case—and use it to create multiple claims on the same sats. That’s **rehypothecation 101**. And when multiple people think they own the same Bitcoin, guess what? **They don’t.**

That’s how you suppress the price of real Bitcoin. That’s how you neuter the supply shock that *should* be happening when millions of people FOMO in. Because instead of those buys hitting the spot market and draining actual BTC from circulating supply, they’re going into **synthetic products**. TradFi IOUs. Ghost Bitcoin.

You're not moving the needle. You're feeding the illusion.

This is how Wall Street has always played the game. Gold markets are a cautionary tale. **The paper gold market is 100x the size of the actual gold held in custody.** That didn’t happen overnight. It happened because people stopped demanding the real thing. They stopped *taking delivery*. And now gold’s price has been effectively suppressed for decades while banks shuffle IOUs in an endless shell game.

And they’re doing it to Bitcoin next.

BlackRock doesn’t want sound money. They want predictable returns, regulatory control, and another revenue stream. They want to neuter Bitcoin—turn it into a boring number on a spreadsheet—**not a monetary revolution**. And by buying into these ETFs, you’re giving them the ammo to do it.

Every dollar that goes into a Bitcoin IOU instead of self-custodied BTC is **a vote for centralization**, **a vote for price suppression**, and **a vote against the ethos of Bitcoin itself**.

It’s not just about your own safety anymore—it’s about the *network*. Every sat you leave in their hands is one more sat that can be leveraged, re-loaned, and used to *dilute real ownership*. You are giving the tools of control right back to the very people Bitcoin was built to escape.

So be smart. Opt out of the clown show. Run your own full node. Hold your keys in cold storage. Don’t get suckered into the next rug-pull and cry later because “I thought it was backed 1:1.”

You've been warned, you have no excuse now.

Regardless of that I think that BTC is that engrained in mainstream culture now that it’s going to rise solidly for a good while yet, the rest of the coins however are all shitcoins (and have nowhere near as much exposure) and I’ll be getting out of all of them next time BTC goes on a little pump.

It seems like a move to bring manufacturing back to the US, which could help the domestic economy short-term.

But the real elephant in the room? **Debt.**

The U.S. national debt keeps skyrocketing. Fewer countries are willing to buy U.S. treasuries, and the only way to sustain the system is to print more money and issue more debt. Sounds familiar?

I recently came across this documentary that breaks it down pretty well:

📽️ [The End of the Road: How Money Became Worthless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Co_tVd9gA2I)

It highlights a key turning point in 1971 when the U.S. abandoned the gold standard. Since then, we’ve been in the era of **fiat money**, where currency is backed by… nothing. The result? A debt-based monetary system that resembles a classic **Ponzi scheme**, where new debt pays off the old.

This raises serious questions:

* How long can the system last?
* Will it collapse under its own weight?
* Is **hyperinflation** inevitable?
* Is Bitcoin the exit door?

I chose one investment over the other and was comfortable with the repayment plan. People demonize loans for crypto, and for good reason. But I'd like to throw this out to consider:

1. 401k loans include a spread of your pre and post tax contributions. This means you get a partial tax advantage investment in btc.
2. You pay interest in 401k loans, but the interest goes to your account. It is, however, post-tax specifically for the interest portion of your payments. Something to consider.
3. Obviously, you can do this before a time of uncertainty. I saw liberation day as a threat, so I noped the heck out.
4. Time is indeed ticking with the price increase of BTC. I wanted a meaningful investment asap while I dca as well.

Things to consider.
1. Each employee 401k plan is different. Example: For some, if you lose your job, you need to pay back that loan asap. That was not the case for me.
2. BTC can plummet. Don't chose a huge loan you can't support the interest and payments on if you were to lose your job and BTC becomes half the value from when you purchased it.
3. Nuking your 401k for an all-in on BTC is stupid. Just an opinion. Diversify.

I'm not here to promote immature handling of your money by taking out loans on high-risk investments. This is a massive decision and should check every single box before pulling the trigger. But I do want to expand people's minds to ways they can thrift their investments. For me, it was a no brainer win to secure a huge chunk of BTC. ",0.71

>It appears that users are well aware of the point made in a previous email that moderators are generally not available for hours after commencement of a trade and cannot even be summoned during the pendency of an active trade and prior to the expiration of the timer which activates the ""Dispute"" button on the platform. After a dispute is raised, hours may pass before a moderator responds. In both cases mentioned previously, users escaped moderation and possible consequences by releasing escrow and today continue on the platform as before. Both are now active, despite submission of extensive evidence of unscrupulous behaviour contrary to Paxful's Terms of Service, because neither was subject to review by Paxful staff.

>Advertisers typically use abusive language, threaten counterparties, and even pose as moderators. After an extended period of time - generally 5 1/2 to 6 hours - the advertisers release locked escrow.

>One cannot but conclude that the ability to lock coins and detain counterparties is a function which should not be available to the users who themselves attempted multiple instances of criminal conduct, including fraud, using the Paxful platform. One could argue that, once a dispute has been raised, all functions available to relevant platform users should be disabled pending review by Paxful staff.

>Many of the websites involved are badly misconfigured and could be taken down with relative ease, but my understanding is that such action would be illegal. In any event, the managers would simply change hosting services.

I’ve been in Bitcoin since 2021, with a good fundamental understanding, but now I’m AWAKE. I still have a way to go, but I have learned a lot and my conviction has increased massively, and so has my allocation to Bitcoin.

A couple of things I am thinking about though which I wanted to get everyone’s thoughts on (and forgive the brain dump nature of my questions):

1. Incentives for miners once all BTC I mined: I know this is a long way off, beyond our lifetimes,  but it’s still important to me to understand. Once we’re (they’re) there, the fees will become the only compensation for the miners, so they need to be enough to incentive them to keep the network secure. But how does this affect the original intended use case for widespread adoption as a digital cash? If the fees need to be expensive enough to compensate the miners, and the bigger transactions therefore get prioritised all the time, could this become a problem? 

I’m aware of course that those fees becoming “expensive” actually means expensive only in fiat terms, and on a bitcoin standard that is not important. But it’s still something that’s on my mind, because I’m thinking people trying to complete small transactions will need to pay more in fees to get included in blocks.

2. Adoption at scale for day-to-day transactions: now this very much feeds on from the first question, and stems from the fact that Satoshi aimed to create digital cash. Right now we seem to be very much is store of value / digital gold mode, which is fine, because Bitcoin is the hardest asset in existence and therefore will naturally take that role. But do you guys ever worry about there not being the tools / solutions in place to allow for mass adoption as “digital cash”?

To expand on what I mean here: Layer 1 is of course better suited for large transactions, which is why my mind always goes to digital gold, where it can be used to settle final balances between parties after multiple transactions have taken place (similar to how countries would settle trade balances in larger periodic transfers of gold historically). Hence the need for lighting network, where we can have channels and other cool innovations that allow for this kind of stuff at high speed, large scale and low cost.

But I am concerned that not enough is happening here on L2 / lightning to allow for mass adoption in the timescales we need. The reason I have this concern is because I’m seeing the rise of stable coins, and starting to wonder if they, as well as some PoS chains out there, will almost become defacto L2’s to Bitcoin; in that they will be used for fast, day-to-day transacting, and then the final balances are written into the most immutable and secure ledger in existence… Bitcoin. I’m not even saying this is a bad thing, but it’s just something that I think about a lot!

I would be very appreciative if anyone is able to shed some light on any of this for me, or provide me links to any resources that explain it.

Thanks!",0.59

 So basically I need help, I am pretty sure my ports are opened.

All tips are appreciated

Weeks would go by, and he would show more interest, ask me some questions about Bitcoin. I recommended buying $iBIT (the Bitcoin ETF from BlackRock) because it was similar to what he was used to, buying an ETF in his brokerage account.

Last time I saw him, he told me Citibank would NOT allow him to buy $iBIT from his brokerage account. He also told me he tried to buy Bitcoin from Coinbase, but was not allowed to as Citibank would not transfer the funds to Coinbase!

He told me he ended up buying Bitcoin through his significant other’s Robinhood account.

There are new ways emerging that Bitcoin will disrupt the financial system, ways that will cause a shit storm for those who have not been paying attention.
* **The Hierophant (pictures a high-priest sitting on a throne, seated between two pillars)**: Bitcoin is the high-priest, watching the blazing idiots of the world pretend that their power is greater than bitcoin or blockchain tech. The institutional powers that are in control of the world financial system are starting to realize that they are fucked.

Hear me out: Rome wasn’t built in a day. It started as a tiny city-state, slowly gaining influence, building infrastructure, and expanding its reach through innovation (roads, aqueducts, military tactics, legal systems). Similarly, Bitcoin started as a niche idea on an obscure mailing list — now it’s reshaping finance, one block at a time. Rome had no central ruler in its early Republic days. Power was distributed, decisions debated. Bitcoin is decentralized by design — no central authority, consensus-driven governance (at least ideally). It’s the closest thing we have to a digital republic. Rome spread its culture across continents. Latin influenced nearly every major European language. Bitcoin’s influence is global too — even countries with struggling economies (hello Argentina, Nigeria, Lebanon) are turning to BTC as a lifeline. Rome built infrastructure that lasted centuries. Bitcoin is building digital infrastructure — a monetary rail that’s incorruptible, transparent, and borderless. Just like Roman roads enabled commerce and communication across vast distances, Bitcoin enables permissionless financial exchange across the world. Rome had enemies, setbacks, and internal conflicts. Bitcoin’s had its own civil wars — scaling debates, forks, FUD, regulatory crackdowns. Yet it survives, adapts, and strengthens. Rome eventually fell, of course. But even its fall birthed the foundations of modern Europe. If Bitcoin ever “falls,” its technology and ideology will remain embedded in future financial systems. So yeah — Bitcoin is Rome. Not just in scale, but in spirit. What do you think? Are we living in the early Republic era of BTC, or have we already crossed the Rubicon?",0.6

My friend is a long term Bitcoin advocate and HODLer, who also operates a wealth mgmt practice at one of the big firms you know of.

Today, in what was otherwise a total bloodbath for global financial markets, they noticed something that completely rocked their world.

IBIT and the other spot BTC ETFs are no longer on their firm’s restricted list for purchases.

Meaning, they (and they assume the other main firms) all officially have full autonomy to invest their client assets into the spot BTC ETFs as of this week.

Which is exactly what they did today.

Further, not only is all the big money in the U.S. now readily available for BTC investment as of this week, but the spot ETFs are also releasing 60% margin.

Which signals the firm’s overall confidence in the resilience of this asset.

(They usually reduce or completely restrict margin for volatile or shaky assets)

As someone who has been in the WM / tradfi space for a long time, while feeling like they need to keep their BTC conviction to themself, I can’t tell you how incredibly shocked, relieved, and excited they are to see this development.

* Scam 1 : The scammer sends some phishing email where he/she pretends to be someone from Ledger/Trezor/whatever. They warn the victim that their crypto are in danger and should be moved to a new address asap. The victim, if gullible and owner of a Ledger/Trezor/whatever, can fall for the trap and transfer their crypto to the address provided by the scammer.
* Scam 2 : Similar to scam 2, but instead of requiring that the Bitcoin be moved to a new address, the scammer says that the victim should give them their 12/24 words so they can protect the funds. You know the rest.
* Scam 3 : The scammer and the victim take contact in some p2p website for selling/buying bitcoins. The victim sends, let's say, 400$ to buy Bitcoins. The scammer doesn't receive the 400$ for now because they are held in escrow by the p2p website until the victim receives the BTC. The scammer sends the BTC to the victim's address but with a fee way too low for the transaction to be confirmed anytime soon. The transaction still appears in the victim's wallet as pending/unconfirmed. The unaware victim tells the p2p website that they receive the BTC. The p2p website sends the 400$ to the scammer. The scammer broadcasts a transaction where the exact same UTXO he sent the victim is now sent to himself, with a high fee, making the original transaction illegal on the blockchain. The victim never receives the BTC.
* Scam 4 : Very similar to scam 3, but this time, the scammer, still with a way too low fee, sends 4000$ in BTC to the victim (they ""inadvertently"" removed a zero after the decimal place). They ask the victim to please send them back 3600$ in BTC. The victim does. Once the scammer receives the 3600$ in BTC, they do exactly the same as in Scam 3.
* Scam 5 : With an AI, the scammer produces a video of Michael Saylor or whoever pretending that this is some kind of time-limited game where he will double any amount of BTC sent to some address. You know the rest.
* Scam 6 : Pig butchering : The scammer (a young girl in some Asiatic country) takes contact with a lonely and rich occidental man. They progressively gain the trust of the victim and convince them to buy some BTC over some legal platform (Kraken, coinbase, whatever). Then, the victim is convinced to send the BTC to some platform for some miraculous investment. Of course, the platform is a fake. You know the rest.

I’ve been buying on Strike for a few months now, no issues. Until now. A few days ago, I tried to buy $1000 worth of bitcoin on Strike. I used the linked bank account as i did the times before. 
However, this time I got an error message that the purchase failed. No big deal right?  So I tried again with $1000. It failed again!  Now I’m thinking that maybe I have a bad signal, so I move and try it again. This time I tried with $2500 (I was going to use it all for bitcoin anyway). This went through!  Yay right?
Later in the day, I find that all 3 purchases had gone through on the app, even though it initially showed that the first 2 purchases had failed. Now, I have @$4500 worth bitcoin. But I only ever had $2500 to spend. I somehow double spend. Twice. Now, Strike won’t release my $2500 worth of bitcoin until I deposit an additional $2000, so the can sell me $4500 worth instead of the intended $2500. 
I’ve been in contact with “Charles” at Strike via the in-app messaging. He’s been polite but unhelpful. The last message was simply that my funds are ”frozen” until I deposit an additional $2k. I informed him I won’t have any more money until the end of April. I spend everything I have on necessities and bitcoin. I don’t have an extra 2k. I’ve been ghosted. I asked for advice on how we should handle it and Charles ghosted me. No communication at all after my last message 2 days ago. 
Any advice?  Has this happened to anyone before with Strike or any other platform?  Strike is essentially holding someone else’s $2k bitcoin with my $2.5 bitcoin, and I have until April 20 to buy the rest. Not sure what happens to my $2.5k after that date, never got an answer from “Charles”. 

Update - Strike has been in contact. The funds are still currently frozen, but it was a legitimate Swiss-cheese-theory event, and the funds will be available when I can actually buy them. The lesson here is not to trust tech too much. I had 2 seeming failed attempts at buying bitcoin and a third successful. But then they were all successful and I bought twice as much bitcoin as I intended, putting me in the proverbial pickle. My best solution would have been for Strike to simply take back the bitcoin that was purchased by error, but as it stands, my bitcoin is still with Strike and will be available whenever I can pay for it (at the price at the time of the erroneous purchase).

The United States is going to integrate bitcoin and stable coins into the current financial system to shore up the dollar and to lower the national debt. They will lower the debt by purchasing bitcoin and owning a portion of the bitcoin network, as well as revaluing gold certificates to bolster up the balance sheet. This will allow budget neutral accumulation of bitcoin. 

They are going to integrate stable coins into the financial system to create massive demand for US treasuries. It has already been proven that it’s unsustainable to so heavily rely on nation states, especially now that competing nations like China are the largest buyers of US treasuries, and they are looking for ways to move away from it such as the BRICS nations, stockpiling and hoarding gold.  

Large segments of the global population just want a way to transact without their local currencies being unreliable, inflated away, and their banks not allowing them to transact freely.  That need in the global marketplace is gonna fuel massive demand for stable coins when the infrastructure and integration is complete.  It’s  gonna make the dollar dig its feet in as the global reserve currency for another generation or two. 

So what does all this mean for asset prices, companies, and stocks? Companies are going to start acquiring bitcoin on their balance sheet similar to how Strategy and others are doing. This is gonna be a add-on effect to them having their cash reserves and their treasuries on their balance sheet generating yield, but bitcoin will be the more attractive choice since it’s returns far exceed what treasuries pay out. Especially with interest rates likely to plummet with the higher demand. As long as companies keep producing goods and services that the world wants to consume and spend their dollars on, they’ll be fine. 

As far as real estate goes, people who store their wealth in real estate rather than just as a place to live, are going to seriously reconsider bitcoin as a better, more secure, more liquid, more convenient store of their wealth. Real estate transactions might also take place with more Blockchain integration due to the attention the technology will get because of bitcoin, but that’s just a small new operational accounting effect, not a fundamental structural global wealth effect. 

Lastly, how does the Fed still fit into this. Assuming they retain their role of stable prices and maximum employment… They will continue to lean into interest rate cuts and money printing to inject liquidity during credit crisis and recessions. However the need to do this over time would actually decrease, and they would also considered buying bitcoin much like they do with Mortage backed securities. It’s unclear for now exactly how all these pieces will fit together. Throw Ai in the mix and it really starts to get wonky. 

The game has a set of rules. And you can change the rules only so much before you find yourself playing a whole new game. Time will tell what comes next. One thing is clear. All roads lead to the money printer in the short-medium term. All roads lead to bitcoin in the short, medium, and long term.

I’m considering the following multisig wallet and would appreciate some feedback. I’m thinking of using a 3-6 setup with the following keys:

* Hot mobile wallet
* Hardware wallet 1 (Coldcard)
* Hardware wallet 1 + master passphrase
* Hardware wallet 2 (Trezor, Ledger or Bitbox)
* Hardware wallet 2 + master passphrase
* Tap signer

For the 3-6 setup, I can recover the wallet from one external location by storing the mobile seed and one hardware wallet seed together, since I could use the external passphrase to reconstruct the third missing key.

**Ideally I’d like to make this a 3/7 setup** but I’m not sure how to do so without using an expensive custodian service. If I add another tap signer and distribute that, then I’ve effectively created two keys on Nunchuk, and the third key is the mobile hot wallet, which is also on Nunchuk. That means if Nunchuk’s key creation were ever compromised, there would be enough signers to execute a transaction.

I’m a student and planning to start a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy for Bitcoin, but my budget is very limited. I have a total of ₨10,000 PKR (~$35 usd) to invest, which I know sounds absurdly small, but it’s all I have saved up.
I’m considering two plans:

1. Buying ₨1,000 PKR (~$3.50) worth of BTC every week for 10 weeks.

2. Buying ₨2,000 PKR (~$7) worth of BTC every week for 5 weeks.

I have two main questions:

1. Is now a good time to start DCA into Bitcoin?
would it be better to begin now i current market conditions?


2. Which approach is better? Should I go for the 10-week plan or the 5-week one? or is there another strategy I should consider with my small budget?


Since this is my only savings as a student, i want to invest it wisely with some gains expected in 6 months to around a year. I’d love to hear from experienced investors who understand BTC trends and mid-long term strategies.

Thanks!",0.66

Theoretically when there is true monetary inflation everybody's wages should rise proportionately. But that's not what's happened. Prices of most goods and services have gone up by a lot but the price of labour has not gone up as much. This suggest what's happening, in addition to the money printing, is that productivity is not keeping up with population growth. Not enough goods and services are being produced for what is needed and so things are getting more expensive.   And because things are not being made, the demand for workers is less and wages are not increasing by much.

As an example, there are 10 million people of working age in Britain who do not work. It should not be a surprise then that prices are rising because these people are consuming but not producing. Increasing production is how prices go down and wages go up. The Chinese understand this but seemingly not anyone else.",0.3

This being new in the field, 
My experience with Swissborg was catastrophic. I thought I was using a simple and reliable platform, but that was a big mistake.  

Here's what happened: I verified my identity with my valid passport, then provided a French bank statement as proof of address to progress to level 2 verification. My balance was only €200, well below the €5,000 supposed to trigger the proof of address requirement.  

However, their response was to immediately block my account, under the pretext that they had not ""validated"" my supporting document, even though no law requires such a document for such a small amount. Worse, they threatened me with permanent restrictions if I did not provide a document that even traditional banks do not ask for.  

Their customer service is a joke: automated, copy-pasted responses that ignore their own rules. Level 1 ""Verified Identity"" normally allows transactions up to €5,000 without proof of address, but they have chosen to ignore it. When I reminded them of what the ACPR stipulates, they persisted in their refusal, brazenly lying about ""the regulations"".  

The icing on the cake: their KYC service seems to ignore their own terms and conditions when it suits them. The only positive thing in this story? Their referral system earned me €30 in BTC before I left this platform.

Conclusion: Flee Swissborg and choose a more serious, coherent platform that respects its customers.",0.33

This initiative would allow Washington to centralize essential digital assets, particularly Bitcoin owned by MicroStrategy and Coinbase's trading infrastructure. By appropriating these platforms, the government would have a powerful tool to influence cryptocurrency markets and prevent the erosion of the dollar in the face of uncontrolled digital assets.

Another key lever in this strategy lies in the management of stablecoins. Rather than adopting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which raises fears in terms of surveillance and restriction of individual freedoms, the American administration seems to favor the regulation and supervision of stablecoins issued by the private sector. This choice would allow the United States to maintain market flexibility and confidence, while ensuring indirect control over international financial flows. By placing these stablecoins under strict regulation and favoring actors aligned with its interests, Washington could maintain the dominance of the digital dollar without sparking massive opposition from businesses and citizens.

Nationalization could not, however, be carried out brutally. Too direct a move would risk frightening investors and triggering distrust in the American financial system. A more subtle approach would be to increase regulatory and legal action against these companies, forcing them to accept a takeover under the guise of compliance. Another option would be to promote a patriotic discourse, asserting that the integration of these platforms under government control is a necessity for national security. The highlighting of foreign economic threats, notably the rise of Chinese and Russian cryptocurrencies, could justify this gradual absorption under the benevolent gaze of the public.

But this strategy could also accelerate the fall of American hegemony. By resorting to economic blackmail and abusive sanctions, the United States runs the risk of accelerating the fragmentation of the global financial system. The pressure exerted on their allies, commercial decoupling with China, destabilizing customs tariffs and the stated desire to appropriate strategic resources in Ukraine or Greenland are seen as signs of aggressive economic imperialism. This posture, associated with an attitude of authoritarian domination, only reinforces international distrust and encourages the emergence of multipolar alternatives, notably through the BRICS and the expansion of agreements in local currencies other than the dollar.

Thus, if the nationalization of Coinbase and StrategyB would allow the American government to exercise increased control over the digital economy, it would also mark a new step towards global governance by force. Rather than embodying the democratic and liberal values ​​that it claims to defend, Washington seems to be engaging in a logic where only the balance of power takes precedence. A risky approach that could well precipitate its own decline.

If confirmed, you will be in a prime spot to deliver for those clients who have been paying you millions of dollars for years.”

While Atkins has promised to sell his stake in Patomak, valued at $50 million, Warren called on the nominee to commit to disclosing the identity of the buyer who purchases the firm and how much that buyer pays. Atkins evaded the question. Warren persisted, making it clear that she wanted to ensure the buyer would not be purchasing access and special treatment. 

Atkins ultimately would not commit to Warren’s demands, which clearly exasperated Warren. 

She concluded, “Some people would call that a pre-bribe.”

Atkins will take the reins at a time when the SEC has been barrelling forward in enforcement cases against crypto firms, which have nearly all been dropped in as many weeks. The industry is looking for clear standards on such issues as custody of customer assets, stablecoins, capital reserve adequacy, and a legal framework for DeFi.

My hunch says that the industry will mostly get to write the future policy and regulate itself, which has gone just great in the past.

Okay so this post isn't going to be exactly something new. Some others on this sub have raised the same issues I'm going to highlight, but so far I haven't been able to find a compelling argument on why I shouldn't worry.

I've been doing a lot of thinking about Bitcoin’s adoption by corporations and financial institutions lately, and to be honest, I’m struggling to see why this is necessarily a good thing. I spend a lot of time on r/bitcoin, and I can’t help but notice that so many posts and discussions revolve around price movements. People are constantly celebrating big buys like Michael Saylor’s, calling him a genius. But here’s the thing: I think a lot of us have forgotten what Bitcoin was actually created for in the first place.

As Alex Gladstein so clearly points out in his ""Check Your Financial Privilege"" book (if you haven't I suggest you do or at least read the article on bitcoin magazine), Bitcoin wasn’t created for the wealthy or the privileged. It was created for people who are stuck in broken financial systems, for the unbanked or those living under oppressive governments, for anyone who's suffered from hyperinflation or currency devaluation. Bitcoin was supposed to be a tool for financial freedom, a way for individuals to escape the control of centralized financial institutions.

When we see big institutions like MicroStrategy or BlackRock buying up Bitcoin, it starts to feel less like a revolution and more like a financial game. These companies have the resources, access to capital, and the privilege of playing with Bitcoin as just another asset to diversify their portfolios. Sure, their Bitcoin holdings might drive up the price, but how does that help the everyday person? The ones who need Bitcoin the most are the ones who might not even have access to it in a meaningful way.

It’s frustrating because a lot of the conversation around Bitcoin adoption focuses on price, but that’s not what drew people to Bitcoin in the first place. The whole argument for institutional adoption seems to be that it will drive up Bitcoin’s value and maintain its scarcity. But here’s the thing, if Bitcoin just becomes another reserve asset, like gold, isn’t that a step backwards? It may rise in price, but what’s the point if it’s still confined to the same old financial system? If we let Bitcoin become another asset for the rich and powerful to store wealth in, we risk undermining its original purpose, to give financial sovereignty to *everyone*, not just those with privilege.

We can’t ignore the fact that governments and central banks might start using Bitcoin as a monetary reserve, but then what? It’s just gold with extra steps. The price might skyrocket, but if it’s still controlled by centralized institutions and regulated heavily, what about the average person who wants to use Bitcoin for what it was intended for : peer-to-peer transactions, free from government and corporate control?

Take taxes, for example. Governments have already started to enforce tax laws on Bitcoin transactions, which could lead to more regulation and reporting requirements for individuals. If Bitcoin becomes heavily regulated or taxed like other assets, it could turn into a tool primarily for the rich, just another way for the state to control what should be a decentralized system. Institutions may push for regulatory frameworks that suit their interests and benefit their balance sheets, all while stifling the free, open nature that Bitcoin promised.

Then there’s the issue of exchanges acting as third-party intermediaries. Even though Bitcoin is a decentralized network, we still rely on centralized exchanges to buy and sell it. As these exchanges grow in size and importance, they become more vulnerable to regulatory pressures and government controls. If major exchanges are required to report all transactions or even enforce KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations more strictly, Bitcoin could end up being used only in a way that benefits corporations and governments, not individuals seeking financial freedom.

Let’s not forget that the cypherpunks, the very group that inspired Bitcoin’s ethos, were deeply concerned with the rise of mass surveillance and the growing encroachment of government and corporate control over individuals’ privacy. A major part of why Bitcoin was created was as a defense against this surveillance state, providing individuals with a means to transact without being monitored, censored, or controlled. The vision was always about more than just decentralizing money, it was about decentralizing power itself. Many of those involved with blockchain technology are still working toward this vision, one where centralized corporations are replaced by decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). In a world where DAOs can replace tech giants like Google and Amazon, Bitcoin could be the bedrock of a future that empowers individuals and rebalances economic and political power.

I've learned that the movement that inspired the Bitcoin ethos was also behind TOR and Wikileaks (Resistance money : a philosophical case for bitcoin by Andrew M. Bailey where he mentions it). I don't see TOR nor Wikileaks receiving praise by governments, big corporations or financials institutions, quite the opposite actually. It seems to me that they remains underground as they should.

Satoshi Nakamoto’s original whitepapers and posts never talked about Bitcoin’s adoption by corporations. His focus was always on decentralization, on creating a system where people didn’t need banks or financial intermediaries. He wasn’t imagining a future where Bitcoin was absorbed into the financial system as just another asset to hedge inflation. So, it makes me wonder : was Satoshi even thinking about corporate adoption when he created Bitcoin? Or was the whole idea that Bitcoin would empower individuals, not institutions?

I’m just not convinced that corporate adoption is the way forward. If Bitcoin becomes just another store of value for big companies, then I think it loses the revolutionary power that drew people to it in the first place. It might become ""gold with extra steps,"" but that’s not the future I want for Bitcoin. I still believe in the possibility of a decentralized system where people transact directly with each other, free from the control of governments and corporations. But that can only happen if Bitcoin stays true to its roots.",0.5

We all have mortgages to pay to the bank. As a bitcoin hodler, I’m hoping one day to be able to pay my house to the bank, using the appreciation in the price of bitcoin. 

Assuming bitcoin appreciates enough to be able to pay my house: 

Question 1 - if I transform bitcoin in Fiat, I have to pay taxes correct? So if I have 100k€ to pay to the bank, I have to have 130k€ in bitcoin to pay the 100k€ to the bank and 30k€ in taxes (assuming 30% in taxes to facilitate this example) 

Question 2 - what if some one pays my mortgage for me? For example a friend that has 100k€ in euros and I sell him 100k€ worth of bitcoin. How’s the taxes here in this case? Is this legal? Can it be done? 

Question 2.1 - what if it is a company that trades bitcoin for Fiat? I sell them my bitcoin and they pay my mortgage for example. 

Question 3 - given the examples above, I believe my worries are more or less transparent. Do you know or have any idea more I should consider?

\--

You should basically learn about economics

business cycles

the Austrian school of economics

how inflation and fiat distort economies, the great depression

how free market solutions are always better than government ones 

(free market solutions are often positive sum, while the government is, at best, zero-sum or even negative sum)

And that the need for a standard (in regards for currencies) is paramount, a currency that has inherently has value is of absolute importance. 

I will give you an example that I wrote a while ago just to explain the absolute utility of a monetary standard (Gold, BTC, Silver, etc)

\--

You come into a new town with lets say a pouch that has 2 Dollar's worth of gold. (the unit ""Dollar"" was historically used as a measurement, such as ""Pound"" (weight). a Dollar is a name for 1.5 grams of gold, so in effect, you have 3 grams worth of gold.)



You come to this town for their very amazing financial sector, and for some odd reason... Eggs!  


So you find the nearest bank to deposit your gold, let's assume you pay a Dollar for a year to deposit your money.  


They ask you if you want an IOU, which is a paper slip that promises that they will give you the amount of gold you have written on the paper in exchange for actual gold, at any time, and you say yes.  


Note: If you look at the actual British Pound today (look it up), it still says ""I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of ""X"" Pound Sterling"", which is a reference to paying the amount of pounds of gold back. when ""pound"" used to mean the weight of the actual material.  


They gave you 10 paper notes, each accounting for 1/10th Dollar (notice the abstraction)  


Now gold is inherently valuable, much more so than silver, so, in this example, if you wanted to buy a dozen eggs, the amount charged by the farmer might be low in comparison to the gold that he wants in exchange (it is less than a single gold paper note);  


Meaning you're going to pay too much unless you exchange your moneyto more of something that is less valuable; In this example, Silver  


So before you buy your dozen eggs that are worth half a gold paper note, you go to a silver trader.  


For this demonstration, a singular gold-backed IOU is worth 2 silver-backed IOU's (IOU being the promise that you can exchange it for actual silver at the bank.)  


So you exchange 5 (half) of your 10 gold-backed paper money to 10 silver-backed IOU's.  


Meaning, you have 10 Silver slips, and 5 Gold slips.  


Now that you have the equivalent of ""half a gold paper note"", being the silver IOU, you can finally go buy your dozen eggs that cost 1 silver IOU, and you indeed buy them, with 9 silver IOU's remaining.  


Now if you go back, you have actually successfully traded your pouch that has 3 grams worth of gold into a subscription to use a bank's facilities for one year, 5 gold-backed paper IOU's, 9 silver-backed paper IOU's, and a dozen eggs.  


So if you choose to trade your IOU's for actual gold, you get gold (or equivalent) that is worth 0.95 Dollars, as you spent 0.05 Dollars (so half a gold backed paper note, or more accurately, one silver backed paper IOU) to buy eggs,  


(The term note, slip, IOU, paper, etc. are used interchangeably)  


Now scale this Ad Infinitum. the ""economy growing"" means more people using money to exchange goods and services, and more people coming in from outside and depositing their gold to interact with the local economy to trade in positive sum development.  


The bank loans out the money that you payed to use their services. They might charge interest to make back the risk they took, or they might invest money and get back their investments in the form of shares in newly established companies. 

\--  


As you can see in this simple example, no government was ""needed"", no taxation is ""necessary"", and no inflation ""eased the economy"".  


Unfortunately we live with the big 3 lies. (I can explain further if you want, this topic is big enough as it is)

Now, thankfully, bitcoin is decentralized

No government can truly 100% regulate bitcoin 

(loopholes will always exist; even china is embracing it rather than cracking down on it, which says a lot about that police stat)  


Bitcoin is transparent and private (enough) to make taxation practically impossible, unless you declare it yourself.  


Bitcoin is NOT inflatable. It is a strict supply of 21 million coins that will ever exist, and until then they reward book keepers to maintain a TRUTHFUL and TRUSTFUL ledger.  


The ledger technology created was the first of its kind, spawned a whole new asset class (crypto currency)



Bitcoin facilitates internet transactions (P2P Cash system)

Bitcoin has ALWAYS (and will always) grow/n; there is demand for a internet money

Think Indians logging on for the first time

Chinese, Americans, Europeans all using a common currency to exchange

a currency that will ONLY grow as more people buy cellphones, laptops... More people learn about bitcoin

more people realize that governments arent magicians that bring free stuff and prosperity

more people that realize using decentralized and trustless stores of wealth rather than centralized ones is infinitely better

more people that realize that invisible money, untaxed money is ALWAYS better than visible, taxable wealth.



FDR stole all of America's gold by decree in 1933 and formally abolished the Gold Standard after making a mockery out of it

The government inflated the dollar irreversibly as a fix for the Great Depression 

Which was something that could've ended so much sooner, yet ultimately prolonged as the government kept distorting the economy, intervening, and inflating the value of the dollar.



Bitcoin prevents that.  


MEANING, any speculative dip is a win because actually, bitcoin is yet so undervalued as it is, and any dip means that you get to own it for a bit cheaper, you get to be early in a truly free age (at least a preview of it) where free and sovereign money exists and is STILL attainable.

He explained to me the difficulty of proving that my hot wallet is indeed mine and not that of another person.

From reading it seems as umbrel Home received the most negative feedback and some say bitcoin core doesn’t fully run on a raspberry pie? I’m quite confused and hope you guys can bring some light.

It’s a silent project that operates in the background. There’s no face to it. The founders created it and walked away. It’s like an elegant clock set into motion that continues to tick. There’s no promise of some complex protocol to come 3, 5, or 10 years down the road. It does what it’s supposed to now without self promotion from the founders. Since it doesn’t need promotion to thrive, it doesn’t fall victim to the vices of marketing from greedy, charismatic leaders, with overly complex projects. Sure, there’s Saylor and Novogratz that sometimes fall into that role. But bitcoin doesn’t need them to survive and won’t need them when they die. The project works now. It does what it’s supposed to and it’ll continue to do what it’s supposed to. It’s the money of the future of our science fiction novels. 

There’s no Krypto Kris marketing shitty debit cards. There’s no charismatic Do Kwon doing a Forbes, Steve Jobs photo shoot with a black t-shirt and a white background. There’s no J Powell magically expanding the money supply with a … wand, creating a 9 trillion USD balance sheet out of thin air. 

BTC takes out the corruption of humans, because the humans that created it stepped away.

However, the convenience of IBIT within my brokerage account is hard to beat, and it's easier to list my family as beneficiaries. I have made it very clear to them that if something happens, and I decide on a wallet, they are not to enlist the help of ""the kid who knows computers next door"" for help accessing it. I have one specific friend I trust to help them.

It's also worth consider that I could mess up with the wallet too, especially if I'm DCA'ing weekly. Not that I think I would, but it's pretty hard to mess up buying shares.

What are your thoughts?",0.5

English Text below...,0,22,"A bombshell in Berlin: As several government insiders confirmed today, the party leaders have surprisingly agreed on a complete Bitcoin ban in Germany during the ongoing coalition negotiations. The decision is seen as a concession to the fiscal and environmental demands of individual parties.
""Yes, it has indeed been decided. Bitcoin and all related cryptocurrencies should be banned by the end of the year at the latest,"" said a well-informed insider.
Climate goals in focus
Negotiators cited the ""devastating consequences"" for the climate and the environment as the main reason. ""The enormous electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network clearly contradicts our ambitious climate goals,"" explained a spokesperson. ""We no longer want to waste green electricity on pointless computing operations, but rather advance the energy transition.""

Crisis of cryptocurrencies has long been rife, particularly from environmental policy experts. A high-ranking representative of the negotiating parties emphasized: ""Bitcoin is an energy trap that we simply cannot afford in light of climate change.""
Uncertainty on social media

But take a step back really, there are no clear signs that we’re heading into a recession or a true market breakdown. If the macro structure holds, BTC is still on track for a cycle top later this year. 

Why This Isn’t a Macro Breakdown (Yet)

1. Tariffs as a Temporary Hurdle
	•	Leverage, Not a Permanent Shock:
Tariffs often serve as a negotiation tool rather than a lasting economic barrier. As talks progress, these fears could subside, similar to past trade disputes.

2. Inflation Is Stable
	•	No signs of a 2022-style inflation spiral that would force the Fed to tighten aggressively.
	•	The Fed can still ease later this year—which is what typically fuels Bitcoin’s late-cycle parabolic runs.

3. Unemployment Is Fine
	•	No major labor market weakness → No imminent recession.
	•	Bitcoin’s worst crashes happen when unemployment spikes and liquidity dries up—that’s not happening right now.

4. Bitcoin Follows Traditional Cycle Timing
	•	Historically, BTC cycles peak after the halving, usually in Q4, not Q1. 
	•	2017: BTC topped in December.
	•	2021: BTC double-topped in Q4.
	•	2024? The structure is still intact unless macro conditions break down.

5. The Key Risks: Inflation & Unemployment Surprises
	•	If inflation reaccelerates, the Fed might delay rate cuts—bad for risk assets.
	•	If unemployment spikes, liquidity dries up.
	•	But until then, there’s no reason to assume Bitcoin has already peaked.

Bitcoin’s Likely Path from Here
	•	Short-term shakeout → Consolidation → Final leg up into Q4 (unless inflation/unemployment forces a macro shift).
	•	This pullback looks eerily similar to mid-cycle corrections in 2017 and 2021 before the final blow-off top.

If inflation stays tame and the job market holds, expect BTC to reverse and continue its cycle as planned. ",0.85

Why moving? Well, Ledger is a big company, and the more I read about it, more it makes me think that they're not so interested on privacy or security it self. They're more worried about convenience for their users... But convenience has its price (Security). If you don't know what I'm talking about, think for a second about their Recovery Service, that just stores your private key on their servers. That said, does it means its insecure and has a backdoor? Who knows, maybe... but if you're storing your life savings you should do it with the most secure device you can get, right?

Banks, institutions & governments are buying bitcoin by the thousands, with estimates predicting that they will own the majority of circulating bitcoin within a decade.

It seems like the government, banks & institutions came to the understanding that it's not feasibly possible to ""kill"" bitcoin, but by simply adopting bitcoin, they actually directly threaten it's very reason for existing, without the average bitcoin enthusiast even realising. And many even supporting it.

That's what confuses me about the pro-institutional adoption crowd. 

You have to ask yourself: What is bitcoin's utility? Why is bitcoin worth something? What are the long term consequences of large scale institutional adoption?

You can participate by: celebrating at home, joining online, hosting/attending events, creating content, or supporting the initiative. Our hub at pizza.day will connect global celebrations.

We need r/bitcoin's help to make May 22, 2025 the largest crypto celebration ever. Visit pizza.day, share your ideas, spread the word, and start planning. The 10,000 BTC pizza purchase didn't just make history - it created the foundation for everything that followed.

Imagine telling someone only 40 years ago, or 100 years ago that they would be able to save and move their savings across space (borders) or across time (generations, if you will), just by knowing 21 words. That´s it. No intermediaries, border controls, worries about inflation or cash reserves in times of emergencies. No fucking banks. Think about it. Removing fucking banks and government out of the equation. What a progress for humanity. 

Who in their right mind would give up on that, no matter your background, wealthy or poor, ideology or political inclinations - you have to be BRAIN DEAD to not want that for yourself and your family.

\- Bitcoin becomes much stronger in times of more governance and markets instability across the globe, with old institutions and the legal system falling apart (after all, you can buy laws today if you have enough money, and international law proved to be more of a fantasy rather than something that is still being respected)

Upon completion, the researcher rewards one monkey with a cucumber slice, while the other receives a grape – a treat capuchins prefer significantly more than cucumbers.

Initially, the monkey given the cucumber accepts it, though perhaps with mild hesitation. But when the experiment is repeated and the same unequal rewards are distributed once again, the cucumber-receiving monkey typically protests – often throwing the cucumber out of their cage (or even back at the researcher) in frustration. Notably, both monkeys are content when they both each receive cucumbers, and they’ll even perform the task without any reward for a time. However, when one is favored in clear sight of the other, the less-rewarded monkey’s resentment is unmistakable.

This behavior reveals a striking insight: a sense of justice is hardwired into us, predating human society and evident even in our primate relatives. On a fundamental, intrinsic, instinctive level, we are reflexively disgusted when we're the recipient of a comparative injustice.

Here's where fiat comes in. Suppose your employer asked you to perform the same job as last year, with equal effort, but offered you a lower salary this time. Your immediate reaction would likely be one of instinctive, reflexive disgust. 

But what if your pay could be reduced covertly, without triggering this instinctive response? How might that be achieved?

In a fiat system, your employer can 'raise' your salary annually while still effectively paying you less. This is achieved by increasing your pay below the rate needed to match the true decline in your purchasing power. Official inflation figures, like the Consumer Price Index (CPI), underrepresent the rising costs of assets such as housing, stocks, land and business premises, all of which far outpace mass-produced goods in the long run. Your modest salary bump might leave you and your colleagues feeling underwhelmed, but it doesn’t provoke the same raw anger as an outright pay cut.

Many assume salaries are determined solely by market forces – supply and demand determining a 'fair' price for your labor. But this is only partially true. You, along with all workers globally, play an active role in valuing your labor. Without some mechanism to disguise your pay cut, you wouldn’t willingly work for less this year than last – your innate sense of fairness would rebel.

Fiat currency provides the shrowd to mask the injustice. The muted frustration of a 'pay rise' that doesn’t quite keep up with your ability to afford scarce assets – like a home – differs powerfully from the visceral disgust of seeing your paycheck shrink outright. These inadequate 'pay rises' have been occurring globally for over 50 years now. That sense you have that everything is broken is precisely this.

And in a economic system underpinned by a hard-capped currency like BTC, this deception would be impossible. To reduce your pay, employers would have to lower the nominal amount on your payslip, and everyone else's. The resulting outrage would be swift and collective. Workers would resist en masse.

Fiat currency concentrates wealth among those who already own substantial assets, whilst those with few or no assets struggle to keep up. It does so by cutting everyone's pay globally, every year. Housing and land and the S&P 500 and rare art and fine wine and the Mona Lisa are not rising in price. Your pay simply keeps falling. This trend will persist unless workers demand compensation in a currency immune to such deception.

Bitcoin is not rightwing. Those who think it is have not understood it yet.

# 🚀 1. Buy, Hold, and Tune Out the Noise

Bitcoin's journey has been marked by significant highs and lows, yet it has consistently demonstrated resilience.​

* **Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA):** Regularly investing a fixed amount in Bitcoin, irrespective of its price, can help mitigate the effects of market volatility. This disciplined approach often proves more effective than attempting to time the market.​
* **Self-Custody:** Maintaining control over your private keys is paramount. Utilizing hardware wallets ensures that your Bitcoin holdings remain secure and under your direct control. Remember, if it's not in your wallet, it's not truly yours.​

# 📊 2. Trading vs. Stacking: Evaluating Your Approach

Investors often grapple with the decision between active trading and long-term holding (stacking).​

* **Swing Trading:** While short-term trading can be profitable, it requires a deep understanding of market trends and carries significant risk. Many traders find it challenging to consistently outperform the market.​
* **Long-Term Holding:** Historically, holding Bitcoin over extended periods has yielded substantial returns. Notably, some analysts predict that Bitcoin could reach prices between $138,000 and $225,000 by the end of 2025. ​

# 🔐 3. Safeguarding Your Bitcoin Holdings

Security remains a critical concern for all Bitcoin investors.

* **Hardware Wallets:** Storing your Bitcoin in hardware wallets protects your assets from online threats and exchange vulnerabilities.​
* **Caution with Leverage:** Engaging in leveraged trading can amplify gains but also magnify losses. It's advisable to fully understand the risks before considering leverage.​
* **Cold Storage:** For long-term holdings, cold storage solutions offer enhanced security by keeping your private keys offline.​

# Staying Informed in a Dynamic Market

The cryptocurrency landscape is continually evolving, influenced by technological advancements, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors. For instance, recent market analyses suggest that Bitcoin's price could fluctuate between $30,000 and $50,000 in the coming months, highlighting the importance of staying updated on market trends. ​

— A Caution for the Curious, 2025

They gathered ‘round the flickering screen,
In pixel’d halls of orange sheen,
To ask once more with anxious breath:
“Is now too late?” (they feared regret).

For lo! In ages not long past,
In twenty-seventeen’s bright blast,
The coin soared up to twenty grand—
A titan rise, none could withstand.

“But then it fell!” the watchers cried,
“A bloody bath!” the brave replied.
And those who dared to buy that peak
Were mocked for dreams that dared to speak.

Yet from the ash, in years anew,
The phoenix stirred in twenty-two.
“Oh Lord, it’s fifty!” then, “One-hundred!”
Each parabolic climb was blundered.

2024, the halving came,
The miners smiled, the skeptics blamed.
And here we stand—two score plus four—
With Bitcoin priced at eighty-four.

Again, the chant begins to swell:
“Too late am I? Can this still sell?”
A tale as old as satoshis mined,
A fate each cycle redefines.

They’ll scoff at $300k one day,
And curse they hadn’t bought today.
Then comes the crash—how vast, how great!
“Rejoice!” they’ll say, “I dodged my fate.”

And when it crashes, fierce and fast,
To one-six-oh—it holds, at last.
They’ll pause, still watching, lips drawn tight,
And mutter, “Damn… I missed it. Right?”

For every boom and bust they see
Is just the coin’s soliloquy.
The market mocks the cautious soul,
And plays the same eternal role.

So come ye lurkers, doubt no more,
The train’s not gone—it loops the floor.
Just know this law: what climbs must dip,
But time rewards the faithful grip.

A few were interested, and I helped them set up wallets with Electrum. I told them they needed to write down their seed phrase and store it forever, or they may lose their Bitcoin forever. I was orangepilling before I knew what ""orangepill"" meant (I don't think it was even a term back then.)

Then I sent each of them a little bit of Bitcoin.

Fast forward many years, and Bitcoin reached $100k. I looked at their addresses on the blockchain and saw that they all had hodl'd all these years! Holy crap! I reached out to ask about it.

Turns out, they all lost their coins. All of them. And not in the ""boating accident"" way. They really lost their funds.

""Ahhh well I sold my laptop that I used in college, and that seed phrase, I mean I know it's written down somewhere but I don't remember where...""

From now on, if I am giving Bitcoin as a gift, I send it on a custodial platform. If the recipient wants to learn self custody and withdraw, that is their prerogative.

The vast majority of people are exponentially more likely to lose their own keys than have it stolen by a custodian. If you are reading this post, you are different, you are hardcore, that's why you're on this subreddit. You aren't most people.

The truth of the matter is that 95% (99%?) of the population is not willing or able to self-custody their Bitcoin. They don't want to deal with nodes and UTXOs and fees and confirmations and seed phrases and lightning channel liquidity and...

They just want money that works. They want money that cannot be printed. That is the ultimate promise of Bitcoin.

The early adopters are very hardcore about self-custody. But self-custody isn't the revolution. You've always been able to take self custody of all forms of historical money, all the way back to beads to seashells to gold to dollars.

Self custody is not a monetary innovation. It is not unique to Bitcoin. It's not new.

What *is* unique to Bitcoin is that it cannot be debased, ever. There will be 21 million, and that's it. Bitcoin is **the solution** to debasement, forever. That is the prime innovation. That is what differentiates it from all other forms of money to ever exist. And a normie can still reap the benefits of hard money even if a custodian is holding it for them.

The coming mass adoption of Bitcoin means that most people will choose a custodial solution, just like 99% of humans have done out of convenience in the past. You cannot change human nature. Our job is to steer those people towards the best, safest forms of custodial solutions.

Only onboard friends to custodians which publish **proof of reserves** and **proof of liabilities.** Only onboard people to custodial platforms which use **geographically separated multi-sig** to secure their cold storage. These need to become standard across all custodians.

In the long run, we need to push for federated custody models, where custodians from multiple countries around the world hold a key to a multisig wallet. This can further insulate depositors against local turbulence or property rights violations.",0.88

🔹 **The next Bitcoin halving is around the corner** – Historically, every halving has led to major price surges due to reduced supply. Less BTC being mined = inevitable supply shock.

Some still laugh today.

But if you have 0.04 to 0.28 BTC in cold storage, don’t let the fiat world fool you—
You’re holding a future your great-grandkids will thank you for.

The hard part is already done.
Now it’s just about belief, patience, and not blinking.

Stay humble. Stay sovereign. Stack sats.

0.04 BTC today is around $3,500.

If Bitcoin becomes the world’s reserve currency, a $100M valuation isn’t far-fetched—especially as fiat systems spiral under debt, declining birth rates, and unsustainable expansion.

And if the stars align?
Even 0.04 BTC could one day be worth $4M.

So if you already hold that—or are steadily stacking toward it—
Stay calm. Stay focused. And keep stacking.

What would be the best way to buy SATS in such a regime controlled system. Do you think that there will be major difficulties in buying Bitcoin with CBDCs? Will DEXes be affected by that? Who would even want that crap of a coin to exchange for BTC? 

I guess earning SATS is an obvious answer, that will motivate people to be more creative. Hopefully DEXes won't be affected in any way.

Bitcoin metrics for the uninitiated,0,0,"Most will know about $MSTR and the miners $MARA $RIOT $CLSK and $HUT hodling as early as 2020. Then $TSLA bought some (then sold some) a year later. Now $GME may be triggering a worldwide rush of Public companies buying bitcoin as a treasury asset.

Some key metrics going forward:

mNAV - the multiple of MCAP to the NAV of the hodl. ie. If $GME manage to buy $5bn worth of bitcoin and their MCAP is $10bn then their mNAV would be 2x. This is vitally important. $MSTR have shown a willingness to dilute stock about 2x mNAV and accretively buy bitcoin. Think about it, they can sell one stock for $300 (but only backed by $150 worth of bitcoin) but actually buy a full $300 worth of bitcoin. They are on to a massive winner and their shareholders too!

This brings us to bitcoin yield. $MSTR created this metric (some would say it's rather spurious as bitcoin famously does not have a yield). I believe Saylor invented it to appeal to fiat brained institutional money. Several bitcoin treasury companies now use this metric so it is one to be aware of. $MSTR state that bitcoin yield is ""the % change, during a period, of the ratio between bitcoin holding and assumed diluted shares outstanding"". Basically a measure of how much ""extra"" bitcoin you managed to acquire during a period.

A simpler way to track yield is simply to plot bitcoin per share. This is fundamental to the success of any bitcoin treasury. New entrants like $GME should ensure that btc/share is always increasing. If they are diluting stocks (fiat) and converting into bitcoin they must ensure the mNAV is sufficiently high enough to that they are getting more bitcoin accretion than fiat stock dilution (at least 1x mNAV).>!​!<

But let’s be real—most of us had to learn the hard way. 😅

Some of my biggest mistakes early on:  
❌ Buying BTC at an all-time high, thinking it would “never go down.”  
❌ Selling too soon because I freaked out over a dip.  
❌ Getting distracted by altcoins, only to regret it when Bitcoin pumped.

I used to spend hours on Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube, trying to figure out what was real and what was just noise. Eventually, I realized that understanding market cycles, on-chain data, and real adoption trends makes a huge difference.

# A Shift in Mindset That Helped Me

Instead of chasing short-term gains, I started focusing on Bitcoin fundamentals, long-term accumulation, and finding solid research instead of hype.  It’s been a game-changer.

Curious—what’s a mistake you wish you could undo, or what’s a lesson that changed the way you invest in Bitcoin?

At the moment I only watch two channels: 

1. Bitcoin University. Very good, thoughtful, analysis of everything concerning crypto. Aggressive talking style, which I like for the refreshing absence of vapid niceness. Extremely informative. 

2. MSTR Today. Vastly inferior to the first one but I am still subscribed. It has daily takes with a mixture of useful (and thoughtful) information, and teenage-like pumping, with the most ridiculously hyped tweets you can imagine. If someone tweets the usual vapid soundbites along the lines of ""Bitcoin is the Alpha and the Omega. Bitcoin is the Most Holy Coinity. Bitcoin is a fully new plane of existence"" the guy is sure to have that crap on your screen by dinner time, accompanied by his usual sounds of girlish excitement.

She wanted to transfer the funds from ODX to Binance, but she can’t. The issue is that instead of using the official ODX app, she’s been using a link the guy gave her, which she entered into the ODX app. Now, the chatbot from that link is telling her to deposit $20,000 urgently to ""unlock"" her money, claiming it's a required deposit for the transfer.

This sounds super sketchy. I need help—what should we do?

  
Update :

I would like to thank all the people who advised me, gave me their opinion etc.... As you can imagine, the 48 hours passed and nothing happened. Indeed, as I thought, the initial investments are lost and the guy plays the comedy saying that it's always time to get the money back by giving the money blah blah blah. From what I understand, my family member blocked him, but lost her money. That's it, that's the story, I don't think there will be a sequel, but thanks to you!

Apparently shipped from the UK. That's where the strangeness began. 

No email of confirmation of my order. I visit the site and look for a contact number. There is no contact number. I write an email to their customer support and again they have no email, but a screen appears and you can send them a text via the screen, Again, no immediate confirmation of my text or any other proof of life. 

The day after (Wednesday) I receive an email that says ""we have received your email and we will be in touch"". There is not even a signature, the email seems sent from a child of seven. Only, they don't get in touch all Wednesday and all Thursday. 

These people are supposed to exist and to ship from the UK, which is why I have ordered from them. Now the following questions arise: 

1. Do they exist? Are they a scammy site? Are they about to go bust and not sending any order anymore? 

2. Do they exist in the UK? Or are they people who pretend to ship from the UK, take an order in GBP, don't  give a confirmation of sale because they actually don't have the article and will reply to me, one day, perhaps, when they know that they can source the article from the US? 

I cannot order the Passport in any other way without going straight to the US and going through all the formalities like paying import duties etc., beside the long waiting times. 

The idea was that I order from a reputable company and, if they send me a defect article, I can have a prompt refund or substitution. 

Looks like I am having to do with a microcompany run by yahoos. 

Any experience? Any ways to contact them with a phone number/talk to a human? 

By the by: I know of their existence from Coinkite, who had replied to an email of mine. They told me LNBits is a UK reseller of their ColCard Q. The site has no ColdCard Q, but it has the Foundation Passport, which is my ""second best"" candidate. So I order the Foundation Passport, then write to Coinkite and reply that I visited the site, they have no ColdCard Q available, but I have ordered the Passport. 

They reply to me that they would cancel LNBits from their list of resellers, again giving me some doubts about the professionalism of  LNBits, albeit it would have been easy for Coinkite to visit the site and see that their products aren't offered.

Danijel Habek named as new CEO of Islamic Bank of Bitcoin

The Islamic Bank of Bitcoin, a Bitcoin banking company operating on Islamic Sharia financial principles, today announced the appointment of their new CEO Danijel Habek. Mr. Habek will immediately assume responsibility for all Islamic Bank of Bitcoin operations and strategy. Mr. Habek brings a lifetime of business experience to his new role. He replaces a shareholder who previously had interim CEO responsibilities.

“I look forward to bringing my experience and leadership to the Islamic Bank of Bitcoin” said Mr. Habek. “In my new role as Chief Executive, I will be responsible for establishing a permanent and useful web presence for the IBB, investing in new joint ventures, and continuing our program of interest free loans.”

“The IBB is at the forefront of Bitcoin finance” continued Mr. Habek. “We believe that finance based on Islamic principles is an incredibly beneficial thing for Bitcoin. Having a strong Islamic bank that is prepared to share profit and risks in joint ventures could significantly boost the Bitcoin economy.”

Mr. Habek has been a supporter of the IBB almost since day one, buying a significant amount of shares. All of his share dividends have been ploughed straight back into the bank. “Right away I saw the potential” said Mr. Habek. “I saw how the IBB could benefit the community by helping enterprising people get their Bitcoin business ideas off the ground. That, in turn, benefits all of us.  The religious aspect aside, Sharia banking principles fit perfectly with our early stage economy. They are tailor made for getting things off the ground.”

Mr. Habek’s first task will be to refine the IBB business plan and continue to sell IBB’s new issue of shares on Cryptostocks.com. The resulting capital raised will be spent on a secure and functional new IBB website, investments in new joint ventures, continuing interest free loans, infrastructure lease, and other expenses. He will also be tasked with reassuring IBB customers and shareholders after the migration to Cryptostocks in the aftermath of the GLBSE collapse.

“Our function is to help people reach their goals,” said Mr. Habek. “I intend to run the bank according to that principle. Whether we’re helping people with small loans, getting involved in exciting joint ventures, or engaging in some other type of activity, I will always bear that in mind.”

Danijel Habek is a longtime IT entrepreneur with an intimate understanding of business. After a long and celebrated career as an IT professional, he set up his own IT business in 2003. Since then he has worked on a large number of successful IT projects. Mr. Habek is also known as a man with an exceptional community spirit. He often volunteers his time and expertise to IT projects surrounding his local Sporting Association.

About the Islamic Bank of Bitcoin

The Islamic Bank of Bitcoin is a Sharia compliant Bitcoin banking organization that offers interest free loans and shared profit/loss joint ventures to people of all faiths in the Bitcoin community.

So yeah, deflation bad, Japan etc.

That's because this system is designed to debase money in exchange for ""growth"", in hopes wages keep up with prices etc. 

Technically, from the most basic economic standpoint; **deflation is the natural state of a free market.** 

If you have a static/sound money, and add value into an economy without the ability to debase the money, then prices naturally fall toward the marginal cost of production. When humans get better at making things and companies compete for your business, prices fall to the margin cost of production. 

If there is $10 and 10 apples in an economy, an apple's equilibrium cost in the market will settle at $1. If you add 10 more apples but you can't increase the money supply, those apples would now settle on a cost of $0.50 each. 

The opposite is true as well; add $10 and keep the same 10 apples and apples will settle on a cost of $2 each instead of one.   

This is why only tech prices generally fall; because their production outpaces inflation. And yes, even though a TV will cost 1/2 the price in a few months, **people still buy TVs**. If your money got more valuable over time, you would still buy clothes, food, shelter, cars, gas, have kids, etc. The argument that deflation would cause people to stop spending is bullshit. And again don't forget that deflation would be terrible for this system because we must print to continue so that is also where this lie comes from.

Although we are taught about the different types of inflation, expansion of the money supply is the tide that rises all boats (prices) and the end all be all when it comes to long term inflation. 

This is a big reason, and also a big misunderstanding, on why people gain conviction on Bitcoin. You cannot print more, so if it were the money, every time someone produces more value into the economy, prices fall. You cannot let air of the bike tire (debasement) so the value goes to the people who hold the money. Essentially, if Bitcoin had already been the money, as tech advanced and we get better and better at making things, we could ALL work less etc. Instead people need to change jobs, add jobs, work harder just to keep up on the treadmill

Bitcoin literally stops the treadmill and starts giving the value that used to be stolen via debasement and gives it back to the ones holing the money.

The kicker: Even the ***very last*** person to adopt Bitcoin will see prices around them fall towards the margin cost of production, forever. ",0.94

I'm also not spooked by the volatility since my time horizon is pretty long as I don't plan on selling for multiple years if ever, and I do have conviction in BTC... Having said that, I feel like there's a huge disconnect between the current price and all of the objectively positive news we get literally everyday at this point.

I'm starting to feel like all of these long term price predictions are never gonna happen. I'm keeping a pretty level head about the situation, and maybe l'll feel better once I get to a point where I'm durably (within reason, I realize price crashes are par for the course) in the green at least.

Are they just all trying to buy the dip with the expectation that retall will pump their bags at some point? So called “supply shock” (is this actually possible?)

I mean there's a finite supply of big players out there, and none of them want to pay top dollar for BTC, so how does the price actually hit these 250k by the end of 2025, or 1 mill in 10 years predictions etc?

How does price action actually work?",0.88

His speeches and interviews are more than just technical breakdowns of Bitcoin—they’re reaffirmations of why we’re here in the first place.

He Speaks the Bitcoin Truth We Feel but Can’t Express

Saylor has a way of distilling complex ideas into simple, powerful statements. When he talks about Bitcoin as digital energy, as an unstoppable monetary force, or as the solution to economic instability, it resonates deeply. He says things we already believe, but in a way that feels undeniable.

He Says What We Want (and Need) to Hear

Bear market blues? He reminds us that Bitcoin is inevitable. Price volatility? He reframes it as short-term noise in a long-term signal. Doubts creeping in? He reaffirms that fiat is failing and Bitcoin is the only rational choice. His words provide comfort and conviction when the market tests our patience.

He Grounds Us in the Long-Term Vision

Bitcoin isn’t about getting rich quick—it’s about securing wealth across generations. Saylor hammers this point home, keeping us focused on a bigger picture that extends far beyond day-to-day price action. He reminds us that the volatility is just part of the process, and the real game is measured in decades, not months.

A Reminder to HODL and Keep the Faith

At its core, Bitcoin is about sovereignty, freedom, and opting out of a broken system. Saylor embodies that belief with unwavering conviction. Every time he speaks, he reignites the spark that made us believe in Bitcoin in the first place. He reminds us to lose hope in fiat, not Bitcoin.

That’s why we listen to Michael Saylor—because he doesn’t just talk about Bitcoin. He gets it, and he makes sure we never forget why we do too.",1.0

My questions are:

1. If I wanted to sell/swap BTC on T a n g e m, it is not feasible since the total fees are ridiculous (I have tried this before $50 total on $2000 swapped). But that's also just because everything and all transactions are so insanely slow I feel like I'm doing something wrong. Here are some exs)

\- Depositing money takes like 12-24 hours. I've asked K r a k e n support to look into this and they have told me usually it should be almost instant (which is what I also thought).

\- Sending funds from K r a k e n to T a n g e m for cold storage (takes several hours from memory)

\- Sending funds from T a n g e m back to K r a k e n takes at least 12 hours (I know this because I sent $5 over to see how long it would take 12 hrs ago and it's still not here).

This is super inconvenient if I want to sell for whatever reason.

Surely there is a more conveninet method. Side note: For sending funds from K r a k e n to T a n g e m\*\*, I might be able to do this faster?\*\*

Since I'm currently doing this on bitcoin network which is supposedly slower, but if I send K r a k e n --> S t r i k e via lightning then to T a n g e m (ive heard that this is faster).

\[EDIT:\] Not sure how I did it last time but I sent $30 from K r a k e n to T a n g e m 20 min ago to test how long it would take and yea only took 20 min, is this a reasonable time or is this slow?

Q2: Also does sending transactions technically take 10minutes (since blocks update every 10 minutes or is that not how it works?)

Bitcoin is beautifully simple, yet all those things above seem arbitrary, and the network could probably have worked with any other set of numbers, as long as they’re agreed upon.

From when I started researching Bitcoin (2017) until about 2021(ish), there were a TON of speculations as to why bitcoin would fail, but only really 3 (what I considered at the time) legitimate worries/threats I saw.

1. Scalability - Now resolved via lightening network
2. 51% attack with China's majority mining power - threat came true when they banned bitcoin, but made almost zero impact on bitcoin (something WILD that I don't we talk enough about)
3. Energy consumption - LOL remember when ""legit"" publications said by 2020 bitcoin would consume 100% of the world's energy? Ahhh good times.

\*honorable mention - gov't crackdown, but I never really viewed as a legitimate threat.

So I ask, bitcoin bulls, orange pilled, hodlers, are there any real threats to bitcoin anymore? What would lead it to fail at this stage?

EDIT: Getting comments about societal collapses, apocalypse. If that's the case, we have far bigger issues and priorities. Assuming society and humanity stay in tact, what are the real threats?",0.86

But scammers have become so prevalent in the world of ""technical analysis"" that many no longer believe in it.

So, I decided to explain what TA actually is—and what it isn’t.

What TA isn’t:

TA is not a tool for ""predicting the future."" There is no rule in the world that says, ""If the price hits this support level, it must go up."" In reality, the price will respect that level about 50% of the time—and the other 50% of the time, it won’t. The market doesn’t care about the lines on your screen.


What TA is:

TA is about using these lines not to predict the future, but to gather information.


If Bitcoin has historically dropped to $78K-$80K before bouncing back, does that mean $78K-$80K is a ""SuPpOrT LeVeL™""? No. It simply means that most traders—or more importantly, the traders with the most money—look at Bitcoin at that price and think, ""Nice, that's a price I’m willing to pay.""

This tells you that historically, $78K-$80K has been a good entry point, because buyers have seen Bitcoin as cheap at those levels and were willing to buy.

But that’s true for now. What if, tomorrow, a new pandemic starts? People will have less disposable income and may be forced to sell their BTC holdings. If that happens, the price will likely drop below $78K.

At that point, you'll need to adjust your TA because people will no longer see Bitcoin at $78K as cheap. Due to external factors, $78K could suddenly become expensive, and now most buyers might only be interested at, say, $50K.

So, TA is basically a tool to understand how the market feels about Bitcoin’s price at any given time. But since we’re dealing with human beings, and human emotions can change for all sorts of reasons, TA will never be perfect. That’s why you shouldn’t get too caught up in drawing random lines on a chart—they only tell you what’s happening now, not what will happen in the future.

Of course, if you know that what’s happening now will continue into the future, you can make some predictions.

For example:

We know that governments will continue printing money, because politicians don’t care about their people—they only care about their wallets. Since Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million, while fiat money keeps inflating, Bitcoin’s price will increase in the long run.

We also know that the Bitcoin halving will continue to occur every four years. This means Bitcoin’s supply will keep decreasing, which historically leads to price appreciation.


However, you can never predict the exact timing of the market in the short to medium term. So instead of trading and losing money—like 100% of traders who aren’t selling online courses on how to “get rich trading”—just Buy and HODL Bitcoin for at least four years (ideally for life) and make money like 100% of long-term HODLers.

TL;DR: TA is useful, but HODL is better.",0.79

Bitcoin's capped at 21 million coins total, and most of that's already mined, but l've read a bunch are lost forever, like from old wallets people can't access.

So just asking for some advice now first about the above, of **Q1: how I can fairly quickly change between coins effectively while minimising fees, and Q2: Is it somehow cheaper to manually sell BTC then buy** \_\_\_ **for instance as opposed to just 'swapping'?.**

 

**Q3:** This isn't too big of a deal but, to withdraw from Kraken currently has a 0.0001 BTC fee which is around $10 AUD. This isn't that big of a deal if I'm dealing with larger amounts but if I can minimise this fee that would be great. Just asking, is the setup I've outlined in the below para good / or can it be improved.

 

Right now I am using Kraken pro to first buy BTC or whatever other coin then sending that to T a n g e m over the bitcoin network. However, I've done a bit more research recently and learnt that using 'lightning' network is effectively free. But T a n g e m doesn't support lightning, and so I've found out about 'Strike' and 'River' which allow me to go from kraken pro -> strike -> t a n g e m.

  
Q4: Also is there a faster way to deposit fiat into Kraken? I've done it few times in the past and it literally takes several hours which is a bit ridiculous compared to traditional brokerages with stocks like IBKR etc.

It’s being used as a digital form of gold. And it’s being used as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, without an intermediary, and it’s actually being used like that.

In the world of Bitcoin, this couldn't be more relevant. Many of us have experienced the rollercoaster of emotions that comes with the market's volatility. We've seen our investments dip and rise, and some of us have even panicked and sold at a loss. But here's the thing: while we might lose some value temporarily, the potential for recovery is always there.

When we hold onto our Bitcoin, we’re not just holding a digital asset; we’re holding onto a vision of the future—a future where financial freedom and decentralization are the norms. Every time we choose to hold rather than sell, we’re betting on that future.

On the flip side, think about those who have thrown away their Bitcoin—whether it was due to fear, impatience, or misunderstanding. Those coins are gone forever, and with them, the opportunity to be part of something revolutionary.So, let’s remind ourselves: in this journey, it’s okay to feel the fear of loss, but let’s not throw away our potential. The market will fluctuate, but our belief in Bitcoin’s value should remain steadfast.",0.88

Just opened my wallet after not touching it for 18 months and there was a recent transaction. I panicked, thinking I somehow got ""hacked"", despite self-custody and paranoid levels of security. But I looked closer and no, it was a transaction I sent about 18 months prior.

I didn't trust the timestamp on my wallet software at first, so I checked on some block explorer websites. It's correct. You may think, well maybe your wallet only transmitted it recently, but that's impossible because my PC was off. 

I did send the transaction with a very low fee, which explains why it took a while. But 18 months? How was it not pruned from the mempool by then? Do nodes these days just have massive mempools that don't need pruning? What am I missing here?",0.72
